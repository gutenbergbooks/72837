<p class='c009'>The progress of knowledge naturally
leads to the discovery not only
of new arts, and of new uses for artificial
productions, but of new stores
of natural wealth in the bowels of the
earth itself, and of new methods of
extracting and rendering them useful.
This last point is amply illustrated
by the history of the progressive discovery
and development of our own
most valuable mineral treasures—the
coal and ironstone deposits—which
add so much both to our natural resources
and to our national strength.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, independent of the advance of
knowledge, the exploration and colonisation
of new countries by a civilised
race leads of necessity to the
discovery of regions rich in mineral
wealth, which were unknown before,
and brings new metallic supplies into
the markets of the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Spain conquered Mexico
first, and afterwards Peru and Chili,
Europe became flooded with the precious
metals to a degree unknown
before in the history of modern
nations. When Russia began to
explore her provinces on the slopes
of the Ural, gold-washings were discovered,
which have, by their enormous
yield, made up for the deficient
supply which commotion and misrule
in Central and Southern America had
caused in European countries. The
possession of California by an observant
and curious people, of Anglo-Saxon
breed, was almost immediately
followed by those wonderful discoveries
which have made the world
ring, and have attracted adventurers
from every region. And, lastly, the
turning of keen eyes upon river beds
in Australia—still less known and
examined than almost any district of
America without the Arctic circle—has
brought to light those vast stores
of gold which appear destined to lay
the basis of a new empire in the Australian
archipelago.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor have such discoveries been
confined to the so-called precious
metals. The advance of North American
civilisation towards the head
waters of the Missouri has made
known abundant mines of lead, which
the cost of transport chiefly prevents
as yet from seriously competing with
European produce along the Atlantic
border. The joint march of Canada
and the United States along the
shores of Lake Superior, has laid
open veins of copper of inexhaustible
magnitude—on a scale, we may say,
in size and richness commensurate
with the other great natural features
of the American continent;—while,
of coal and ironstone, the Central
States of the Union are so full, that
imagination itself cannot conceive a
time when they shall cease to be sufficient
for the wants of the whole
civilised world.</p>

<p class='c010'>Men untrained themselves to observe,
and ignorant that it is intellectual
knowledge which opens and
guides the eye, affect to wonder—often,
indeed, do seriously wonder—that
gold so plentifully scattered over
the surface of a country as it is said
to be in California and Australia, or
sprinkling with its yellow sheen thick
veins of snowy quartz, should, for a
time so comparatively long, have
escaped observation. “What surprises
me,” says Captain Sutter, in
whose mill-race the gold was first
discovered, “is, that this country
should have been visited by so many
scientific men, and that not one of
them should have ever stumbled upon
these treasures; that scores of keen-eyed
trappers should have crossed
the valley in every direction, and
tribes of Indians have dwelt in it for
centuries, and yet this gold should
never have been discovered. I myself
have passed the very spot above
a hundred times during the last ten
years, but was just as blind as the
rest of them, so I must not wonder
at the discovery not having been
made earlier.”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Such seeming blindness, indeed, is
not really a matter of surprise. The
ability to observe is an intellectual
gift no less than the ability to reason;
and, like the latter talent, the former
also must be trained. It must be
taught where to look, and what to
look for; what the signs are of the
presence of the thing we wish to find,
and where they are likely to be met
with.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not, in truth, a just reproach
to unsuspecting men, that they have
not seen what they never imagined
the presence of. It would scarcely
have been so, had they failed to see
in a given place what they were told
was likely to be found. Many of our
readers are familiar with the existence
of black lines in the solar spectrum;
many may have seen them,
and justly wondered. Some may
even recollect, when, years ago, Frauenhofer
first announced their existence,
how opticians everywhere
mounted their most homogeneous
prisms, and gazed at the spectrum
eager to see them, and how many
looked in vain. Of course, the failure
was ascribed to the imperfection of
their prisms, and not to their own
defective skill. One philosopher we
remember, then already distinguished,
and whom now all delight to honour,
of whom it was told that having
obtained one of the beautifully perfect
prisms of Frauenhofer’s own manufacture,
he was still unable to see the
lines; but that another who had seen
them came to his aid, instructed him
how to look, and in an instant he not
only clearly saw them, but exclaimed
with wonder at his own blindness.
Such were our own sensations also
when first we saw them. Was it,
then, a reproach to Sir Isaac Newton
and his successors that these lines
escaped them? The same reproach
might be made to the predecessors of
almost every discoverer in every walk
of modern science. Many before him
probably had looked from the same
spot, with similar advantages for seeing,
and had not seen. But they had
gazed without any special object or
previous instruction, and they had
failed to discern what another coming
after them, prepared to look for it,
and knowing what it was like, and
where likely to be, would have at
once descried.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hence the discovery of most of the
rich mines in past times was the result
of some unlooked-for accident
happening generally to naturally-observant
but ignorant men. Thus
Jacob says of the mines in the
Hartz—</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are various conflicting opinions
among the learned in antiquities respecting
the discovery of the mineral wealth of
the Hartz. The most probable accounts
fix it in the tenth century; and the tradition
is, that a hunter of the name of
Ramm, when engaged in the chase, had
fastened his horse to a tree, who, by
pawing with his feet, had scraped away
the soil, and thereby discovered some
minerals; that specimens of them were
sent to the Emperor Otho, to whom all
minerals, as regalities of the Empire,
belonged, and who sent expert miners to
examine the district, from Franconia.”—(<span class='sc'>Jacob</span>,
i. p. 254.)</p>

<p class='c009'>And again of the mines of Saxony—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The mines of Saxony were first discovered
in the tenth century, when the
whole district in which they are situated
was covered with wood and without inhabitants.
Some carriers from Halle, on
their way to Bohemia, whither they carried
salt, observing metallic substances in
the tracks made by the wheels, some of
these were taken up and sent to Goslar
to be examined, when they were found
to consist of lead with a considerable
quantity of silver. This led to the establishments
for mining, which have continued,
with some variations in their
products, from the year 1169 to the present
day.”—(<span class='sc'>Jacob</span>, i. p. 252.)</p>

<p class='c009'>And of the mines of Potosi—</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the latter end of the year 1545
the mines of the Cerro de Potosi were
accidentally discovered. According to
the account of Herrera, the discovery was
owing to an Indian hunter, Diego Hualca,
who, in pulling up a shrub, observed filaments
of pure silver about the roots. On
examination the mass was found to be
enormous, and a very great part of the
population was thereby drawn to the spot
and employed in extracting the metal.
A city soon sprang up, though in a district
of unusual sterility. The mountain
was perforated on all sides, and the produce,
in a few of the first years, exceeded
whatever has been recorded of the richest
mines in the world.”—(<span class='sc'>Jacob</span>, ii. p. 57.)</p>

<p class='c009'>And so with the discovery of the
rich washings of California. As early
as the time of Queen Anne, Captain
Sheldrake, in command of an English
privateer on the coast, discovered
that the black sands of the rivers—such
as the washers now find at the
bottom of their <em>rockers</em>—yielded gold
largely, and pronounced the whole
country to be rich in gold. But it
remained in the hands of the Indians
and the Jesuit fathers till 1820, when
California was made a territory of the
Mexican commonwealth, and a small
party of adventurers came in. Captain
Sheldrake and his published opinions
had then been long forgotten,<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
and an accident made known again
the golden sands in 1848, after the
territory had been ceded to, and was
already attracting adventurers from,
the United States.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The discoverer was Mr Marshall, who,
in September 1847, had contracted with
Captain Sutter to build a saw-mill near
some pine woods on the American Fork,
now a well-known feeder of the Sacramento
river. In the spring of 1848 the
saw-mill was nearly ready, the dam and
race being constructed; but, when the
water was set on to the wheel, the tail-race
was found too narrow to let the
water through quick enough. Mr Marshall,
to save work, let the water right
into the race with a strong stream, so as
to sweep the race wider and deeper.
This it did, and a great bank of gravel
and mud was driven to the foot of the
race. One day, Mr Marshall, on walking
down the race to this bank, saw some
glittering bits on the upper edge, and,
having gathered a few, examined them
and conjectured their value. He went
down to Sutter’s Fort and told the captain,
and they agreed to keep it a secret
until a certain grist mill of the captain’s
was finished. The news got about, however;
a cunning Yankee carpenter having
followed them in their visit to the mill-race,
and found out the gold scales.</p>

<p class='c012'>Forthwith the news spread. The first
workmen were lucky, and in a few weeks
some gold was sent to San Francisco, and
speedily the town was emptied of people.
In three months there were four thousand
men at the diggings—Indians having been
hired, eighty soldiers deserted from the
American posts, and runaways getting up
from the ships in the harbour. Such ships
as got away carried news to Europe and
the United States; and, by the beginning
of 1849, both sides of the Atlantic were
in agitation.”—(<span class='sc'>Wyld</span>, pp. 34, 35.)</p>

<p class='c009'>But when no accident has intervened
to force the discovery upon the
unsuspecting or unobservant, it has
sometimes happened that great riches,
unseen by others, have been discovered
by persons who knew what to look
for, what were the signs of the presence
of the thing sought, and who
had gone to particular places for the
purpose of exploration. Such was
the case in Australia.</p>

<p class='c010'>The preliminary history of the
Australian discovery is peculiar.
From what he had seen of the Ural,
and had learned of the composition of
the chief meridian mountain ridge of
Australia, Sir Roderick Murchison
publicly announced, in 1845, his belief
that Australia was a country in which
gold was likely to be found—recommended
that it should be sought for,
and even memorialised the home
government on the subject.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a> But
although this opinion and recommendation
were inserted and commented
upon in the colonial newspapers—although
the Rev. W. B. Clarke published
letters predicting, for reasons
given, the discovery of gold deposits
in California and Australia—although</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir Francis Forbes of Sydney subsequently
published and circulated in
New South Wales a paper, in which he
affirmed in the strongest manner, on
scientific data, the existence of gold formations
in New Holland—although a
colonial geologist had been sent out some
years before and was settled at Sydney—and
lastly, although one part of the prediction
was soon so wonderfully fulfilled
by the Californian discoveries—yet
oven the discoveries in California did
not arouse the New Hollanders to adequate
researches, though reports were
spread of wonderful discoveries in Victoria
and South Australia, which were
speedily discredited. It was reserved
for a gentleman of New South Wales,
Mr Edward Hammond Hargraves, to
make the definite discoveries. He appears
to have acted independently of all
previous views on the subject; but having
acquired experience in California, and
being struck with the resemblance between
the Californian formations and
those of New Holland, he determined on
a systematic search for gold, which he
brought to a successful issue on the 12th
of February of this year 1850, by the
discovery of gold diggings in the Bathurst
and Wellington districts, and which he
prosecuted until he had ascertained the
existence of gold sands in no less than
twelve places.”—(<span class='sc'>Wyld</span>, p. 30.)</p>

<p class='c009'>When this was made known by
Mr Hargraves in a formal report to
the authorities at Sydney, in April
1850, they then (!) despatched the
provincial geologist to examine the
localities, and confirm the discoveries
of Mr Hargraves! But the public
did not wait for such confirmation.
On the 1st of May the discoveries
became known in Sydney. In thousands
the people forsook the city, the
villages, cattle stations, and farms, in
the interior, for the neighbourhood of
Bathurst, where the gold had been
found. Summerhill Creek alone soon
numbered its four thousand diggers,
who thence speedily spread themselves
along the other head waters of the
Darling and Murrumbidgee—rivers
flowing westward from the inland
slope of the mountain ridge, (Blue
Mountains and Liverpool range,)
which runs nearly parallel to the
south-eastern coast of Australia, and
at the distance from it of about one
hundred miles. Near Bathurst the
summit of the ridge attains, in Mount
Canobolus, a height of 4461 feet. In
numerous places among the feeders
of these streams, which themselves
unite lower down to form the main
channel of the Murray, gold was
speedily found. It was successfully
extracted also from the upper course
of the Hunter River, and from the
channel of Cox’s River—both descending
from the eastern slope of the
same ridge, within the province of
New South Wales. In the province
of Victoria, the feeders of the Glenelg
and other rivers, which descend from
the southern prolongation of the same
chain—the Australian Pyrenees—have
yielded large quantities of gold;
and recently, Geelong and Melbourne
have become the scene of an excitement
scarcely inferior to that which
has longer prevailed in the country
round Bathurst. South Australia also,
where the main river, Murray, passes
through it to the sea at Adelaide, has
been reported to contain the precious
metal. So suddenly does the first
spark of real fire spread into a great
flame of discovery—so clearly can all
eyes see, when taught how to look,
what to look for, and in what circumstances.</p>

<p class='c010'>But in New South Wales, and in
the province of Victoria, the excitement,
and the zeal and success in
digging, have up to the latest advices
been the greatest. In the beginning
of June 1850, the Governor-General
had already bestowed a grant of £500
upon Mr Hargraves, and an appointment
of £350 a-year, as acknowledgments
of his services—acknowledgments
he well deserved, but which
might have been saved honourably to
the colony, and creditably to science,
had the recommendation made five
years before by geologists at home,
and by scientific colonists, been attended
to. In the same month the
Sir Thomas Arbuthnot sailed from
Sydney for England with £4000 worth
of gold already among her cargo. The
success of the explorers continues unchecked
up to the latest arrivals from
Australia. “When I left, on the
10th of August 1851,” says the captain
of one of her Majesty’s ships of
war, in a letter now before us, “there
was then weekly coming into Sydney
£13,000 of gold. One lump has been
found one hundred and six pounds in
weight.” He adds, and we believe
many are of this opinion, “that it
appears to be one immense gold field,
and that California is already thrown
into the shade.” The news of five
months’ later date only give additional
strength to all previous announcements,
anticipations, and predictions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, in reflecting on these remarkable
and generally unexpected discoveries,
an enlightened curiosity
suggests such questions as these:—What
are the conditions geographical,
physical, or geological, on which the
occurrence of gold deposits depends?
Why has the ability to predict, as in
the Australian case, remained so long
unexercised, or been so lately acquired?
What are the absolute extent,
and probable productive durability,
of the gold regions newly brought to
light? What their extent and richness
compared with those known at
former periods, or with those which
influence the market for precious
metals now? What the influence
they are likely to exercise on the
social and financial relations of European
countries? What the effect
they will have on the growth and
commerce of the States which border
the Pacific, or which are washed by
the Indian and Australian seas? In
the present article we propose to
answer a few of these questions.</p>

<p class='c010'>And, first, as to the Geography of the
question. There are no limits either
in latitude or longitude, as used to
be supposed, within which gold deposits
are confined—none within
which they are necessarily most
abundant. In old times, the opinion
was entertained that the precious
metals favoured most the hot and
equatorial regions of the earth. But
the mines of Siberia, as far north as
69° of latitude, and the deposits of
California, supposed to extend into
Oregon, and even into Russian America,
alone show the absurdity of this
opinion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor does the physical character of
a country determine in any degree
whether or not it shall be productive
of gold. It may, like California,
border the sea, or be far inland, like
the Ural slopes, or the Steppes of the
Kirghis; it may be flat, and of little
elevation, or it may abound in
streams, in lakes, and in mountains;—none
of these conditions are necessarily
connected with washings or veins
of gold. It is true that mountain
chains are usually seen at no great
distance from localities rich in golden
sands, and that metalliferous veins
often cut through the mountains
themselves. But these circumstances
are independent of the mountains as
mere physical features. It is not
because there are mountains in a
country that it is rich in gold, else
gold mines would be far more frequent;
and mountainous regions, like our
own northern counties, would abound
in mineral wealth. It is the nature
of the rocks of which a country consists—its
geological and chemical characters,
in other words, which determine
the presence or absence of the
most coveted of metals. Humboldt,
indeed, supposed, from his observations,
that, to be productive of gold,
the chain of mountains which skirt
the country must have a meridional
direction. But further research has
shown that this is by no means a
necessary condition, although hitherto,
perhaps, more gold has been met
with in the neighbourhood of chains
which have a prevailing north or
south direction than of any other.
We may safely say, therefore, that
there are no known physical laws or
conditions, by the application or presence
of which the existence of gold
can with any degree of probability be
predicted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us study for a little, then, the
geology of a region of gold.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>First</em>, Every general reader now-a-days
is aware that the crust of our
globe consists of a series of beds of
rock, laid one over the other, like
the leaves of a book; and that of
these the lowest layers, like the
courses of stone in the wall of a
building, are the oldest, or were the
first laid down. These rocky beds
are divided into three groups, of which
the lowest, or oldest, is called the
primary; the next in order, the secondary;
and the uppermost, or newest,
the tertiary.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Second</em>, That in certain parts of
the world this outer crust of rocks is
broken through by living volcanoes,
which, with intermissions more or
less frequent, belch forth flames and
smoke, with occasional torrents of
burning lava. That where, or when,
the cause of such eruptions is not
sufficiently powerful to produce living
volcanoes, earthquakes are occasioned;
cracks or fissures, more or less wide,
are produced in the solid rocks; smoking
fumeroles appear; and vapour-exhaling
surfaces show that fires,
though languid and dormant for the
time, still exist beneath. That besides
the rocks of lava they have
poured out, these volcanic agencies
change the surface of a country more
widely still by the alterations they
gradually effect upon the previously
existing slaty, calcareous, or sandstone
rocks; converting limestone
into marble, and baking sandstone into
more or less homogeneous quartz, and
common slates or hardened clays into
mica slates, gneiss, and granite-like
rocks. That such volcanic agencies,
producing similar phenomena, have
existed in every geological epoch; and
though the evidences of these are
most extensive and distinct, perhaps,
among the rocks of the oldest or primary
period, that they are numerous
and manifest also among those of the
secondary and tertiary periods.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Third</em>, That rocks of every age and
kind, when exposed to the action of
the air, the vicissitudes of the seasons,
the beating of the rains, the force of
flowing water, the dash of the inconstant
sea, and other natural agencies,
crumble down, wear away, or are torn
asunder into fragments of every size.
These either remain where they are
formed, or are carried by winds and
moving waters to distances, sometimes
very great, but which are dependent
on the force of the wind or
water which impel them, and on the
size or density of the fragments themselves.
Thus are our shores daily
worn away by the action of the sea,
and the fragments distributed along
its bottom by the tides and currents;
and thus, from the far northern mountains
of America, does the Missouri
bring down detached fragments thousands
of miles into the Gulf of Mexico,
whence the Gulf Stream carries them
even to the icy Spitzbergen.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Fourth</em>, That over all the solid
rocks, almost everywhere is spread a
covering of this loose, and, for the
most part, drifted matter, consisting
of sands, gravels, and clays. These
overspread not only valleys and
plains, but hill-sides and slopes, and
sometimes even mountain-tops, to a
greater or less depth. There are comparatively
few spots where these loose
materials do not cover and conceal
the native rocks; but in some localities,
and especially in wide plains and
deep river valleys, they are sometimes
met with in accumulations of enormous
depth. In our own island, a
depth of two hundred feet of such
superficial sands, gravels, and clays,
is by no means unusual. They are
often sorted into beds alternately
coarse and fine, evidently by the action
of moving water; and while the
great bulk of the fragments of which
our English gravels consist can generally
be traced to native rocks at
no great distance from the spots on
which they rest, yet among them are
to be found fragments also, which
must have been brought from Norway,
and other places, many hundred
miles distant.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the surface of these drifted
masses we generally live, and from
the soils they form we extract by tillage
the means of life.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Fifth</em>, That these, occasionally
thick, beds of drifted matter—<em>drift</em>
we shall for brevity call it—are in
some places cut through by existing
rivers, the beds of which run between
high banks of clay, sand, or gravel,
which the action of the stream has
gradually worn and washed away.
This is seen in many of our own river
valleys; and it is especially visible
along the great rivers of North America.
The effect of this wearing action
is to remove, mix up, and <em>re</em>distribute,
towards the river’s mouth,
the materials which have been scooped
out by the cutting water, and thus
to produce, on a small scale, along
the river’s bed, what had long before
been done in the large, when the entire
bed of drift through which the river
flows was itself spread over the plain
or valley by more mighty waters.</p>

<p class='c010'>These things being understood, a
very wide geological examination of
gold-bearing localities has shown—</p>

<p class='c010'><em>First</em>, That gold rarely occurs in
available quantity in any of the stratified
rocks, except in those which
belong to the primary or oldest group,
and in these only when or where they
have been, more or less, disturbed or
altered by ancient volcanic or volcanic-<em>like</em>
action; by the intrusion, for
example into cracks and hollows, of
veins and masses of serpentine, granite,
syenite, and other igneous rocks,
in a melted or semi-fluid state.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Second</em>, That among these primary
stratified rocks a subdivision, to which
the name of Silurian was given by Sir
Roderick Murchison, has hitherto, as
a whole, proved by far the richest in
this kind of mineral wealth; though
the slate-rocks below, and the sandstones
and limestones above, in favourable
circumstances, maybe equally
gold-bearing.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Third</em>, That the drifted sands and
gravels, in which gold-washing is
profitable, occur only in the proximity,
more or less near, of such ancient
and altered (so called metamorphic)
rocks. They are, in fact, the
fragments of such rocks broken up,
pounded, and borne to their present
sites by natural causes, operating
long ages ago, but similar in kind to
those which now degrade and carry
away to lower levels the crumbling
particles still torn off from our hardest
mountains by the ceaseless tooth
of time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Numerous as have been the deposits
of gold found in various ages and
countries, they all confirm the general
geological conclusions above stated.
The main and most abundant sources
of gold which were known to the ancients,
occurred among the sands of
rivers, and amid the gravels and shingles
which formed their banks. Such
were the gold-washings in the beds of
the Phasis, the Pactolus, the Po, the
Douro, the Tagus, and the mountain
streams which descended from the
alpine heights of Greece, of Italy, of
America, of Asia Minor, and of many
other countries. These rivers all descend
from, or, early on their way,
pass through or among, ancient rocks,
generally old and altered Silurian
strata, such as those we have spoken
of, in which the gold originally existed,
and from which the existing rivers,
since they assumed their present channels,
have in some few cases, and to a
small amount, separated and brought
it down. And if in any region, as in
Nubia, Hungary, Bohemia, and Macedonia,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
the ancient or mediæval
nations followed up their search to
the sources of the rich rivers, and
were successful in finding and extracting
gold from the native rocks, later
explorations, wherever made, have
shown that these mines were situated
among old and disturbed deposits of
the primary and Silurian age.</p>

<p class='c010'>The more modern discoveries in
America, Siberia, and elsewhere, prove
the same. So that, among geologists,
it is at present received as an established
fact, that the primary, the so
called azoic and palæozoic rocks, are
the only great repositories of native
gold.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are no known laws, either
physical or chemical, by which the
almost exclusive presence of gold in
these ancient rocks can be accounted
for or explained. A conjecture has
been hazarded, however, to which we
shall for a moment advert.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the fissures and openings
which abound in volcanic neighbourhoods,
gases and vapours are now
seen continually to arise. Whatever
is capable of being volatilised—driven
off in vapour, that is—by the existing
heat, rises from beneath till it reaches
the open air, or some comparatively
cool spot below the surface, where it
condenses and remains. Such was
the case also in what we may call the
primary days of geology.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gold is one of the few metals which
occur, for the most part, in the native
or metallic and malleable state. But
in this state it is not volatile, and
could not have been driven up in vapour
by ancient subterranean heat.
But, as in the case of many other
metals, the prevailing belief is, that it
has been so volatilised—not in the
metallic state, however, but in some
form of chemical combination in which
it is capable of being volatilised. No
such combinations are yet known,
though their existence is not inconsistent
with—may in fact be inferred
from—our actual knowledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is further supposed that, at the
period when the primary rocks were
disturbed by intrusions of granites,
porphyries, serpentines, greenstones,
&#38;c., which we have spoken of as
volcanic-like phenomena, the elementary
bodies, which, by their union
with the gold, are capable of rendering
it volatile, happened to exist more
abundantly than at the period of any
of those other disturbances by which
the secondary and tertiary rocks were
affected; and that this is the reason
why signs of gold-bearing exhalations,
and consequently gold-bearing veins,
are rare in the rocks of the newer
epochs.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to this view of the introduction
of gold into the fissures and
veins of the earliest rocks, its presence
is due to what we may call the
fortuitous and concurrent presence in
the under crust of other elementary
substances along with the gold, which
by uniting with it could make it volatile,
rather than to the action or
influence of any widely-operating
chemical or physical law. The explanation
itself, however, it will be
remembered, is merely conjectural,
and, we may add, neither satisfactory
nor free from grave objections.</p>

<p class='c010'>But from the geological facts we
have above stated, several very interesting
consequences follow, such as—</p>

<p class='c010'><em>First</em>, That wherever the rocks we
have mentioned occur, and altered as
we have described, the existence and
discovery of gold are rendered probable.
Physical conditions may not
be equally propitious everywhere.
Broad valleys and favourable river
channels may not always coexist with
primary rocks traversed by old volcanic
disturbances; or the ancient
sands and shingles with which the
particles of abraded gold were originally
mixed may, by equally ancient
currents, have been scoured out of
existing valleys, and swept far away.
But these are matters of only secondary
consideration, to be ascertained
by that personal exploration which a
previous knowledge of the geological
structure will justify and encourage.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whenever the geology of a new
country becomes known, therefore, it
becomes possible to predict the presence
or absence of native gold, in
available quantities, with such a degree
of probability as to make public
research a national, if not an individual
duty. This led Sir Roderick Murchison
to foretell the discovery of gold
in Australia, as we have already explained;
and similar knowledge places
similar predictions within the power
of other geologists.</p>

<p class='c010'>We happen to have before us, at
this present moment, a geological map
of Nova Scotia. Two such maps have
been published, one by Messrs Alger
and Jackson, of Boston, and another
by Dr Gesner, late colonial geologist
for the province of New Brunswick.
In these maps the north-western part
of the province is skirted by a fringe
of old primary rocks, partly metamorphic,
and sometimes fossiliferous,
and resting on a back ground of igneous
rocks, which cover, according to
Gesner, the largest portion of this end
of the province. Were we inclined to
try our hand at a geological prediction,
we should counsel our friends in
the vale of Annapolis to look out for
yellow particles along the course of
the Annapolis river, and especially at
the mouths and up the beds of the
cross streams that descend into the
valley from the southern highlands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nature, indeed, has given the Nova
Scotians in this Annapolis valley a
miniature of the more famed valley of
the Sacramento. Their north and
south mountains represent respectively
the coast range and the Sierra Nevada
of the Sacramento Basin. The tributaries
in both valleys descend chiefly
from the hills on the left of the main
rivers. The Sacramento and the Annapolis
rivers both terminate in a lake
or basin, and each finally escapes
through a narrow chasm in the coast
ridge by which its terminating basin
communicates with the open sea. The
Gut of Digby is, in the small, what
the opening into the harbour of San
Francisco now called the “Golden
Gate” and the “Narrows” is in
the large; and if the Sacramento
has its plains of drifted sand
and gravel, barren and unpropitious
to the husbandman, the Annapolis
river, besides its other poor
lands, on which only the sweet fern
luxuriates, has its celebrated Aylesford
sand plain, or devil’s goose pasture—a
broad flat “given up to the
geese, who are so wretched that the
foxes won’t eat them, they hurt their
teeth so bad.” Then the south mountains,
as we have said, consist of old
primary rocks, such as may carry
gold—disturbed, traversed by dykes,
and changed or metamorphosed,
as gold-bearing rocks usually are.
Whether quartz veins abound in them
we cannot tell; but the idle boys of
Clare, Digby, Clements, Annapolis,
Aylesford, and Horton, may as well
keep their eyes about them, and the
woodmen, as they hew and float down
the pine logs for the supply of the Boston
market. A few days spent with
a “long Californian Tom,” in rocking
the Aylesford and other sands and
gravel-drifts of their beautiful valley,
may not prove labour in vain. What
if the rich alluvials of Horton and
Cornwallis should hide beneath more
glittering riches, and more suddenly
enriching, than the famed crops of
which they so justly boast? Geological
considerations also suggest that
the streams which descend from the
northern slopes of the Cobequid
Mountains should not be overlooked.
It may well be that the name given
to Cap d’Or by the early French settlers
two hundred years ago, may
have had its origin in the real, and
not in the imaginary presence of glittering
gold.</p>

<p class='c010'>But to return from this digression.
<em>Second</em>, The same facts which thus
enable us to predict or to suggest inquiry,
serve also to test the truth or
falsehood of ancient traditions regarding
the former fruitfulness in gold of
countries which now possess only the
fading memory of such natural but
bygone wealth. Our geological maps
direct us to European countries, in
which all the necessary geological
conditions coexist, and in which,
were the world still young, a geologist
would stake a fair reputation on
the hazard of discovering gold. But
the art of extracting gold from auriferous
sands is simple, and easily
practised. It is followed as successfully
by the black barbarians of Africa
as by the whitest savages of California.
The longer a country has
been inhabited, therefore, by a people
among whom gold is valued, the less
abundant the region is likely to be in
profitable washings of gold. The
more will it approach to the condition
of Bohemia, where gold prevailed to
a great extent, and was very productive
in the middle ages, though it
has been long worked out, and the
very localities of its mines forgotten.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Were it to become, for example, a
matter of doubtful tradition, which
the historian was inclined to pass by,
that in the reign of Queen Elizabeth
three hundred men were employed
near Elvan’s Foot—not far, we believe,
from Wanlockhead in Scotland—at a
place called the Gold Scour, in washing
for the precious metal, who in a
few summers collected as much as was
valued at £100,000; or that in 1796,
ten thousand pounds’ worth of gold
was collected in the alluvial soil of a
small district in Wicklow—the geologist
would come to his aid and assure
him that the natural history of the
neighbourhood rendered the occurrence
of gold probable, and the traditions,
therefore, worthy of reliance.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Third</em>, They explain, also, why it
is that, where streams flowing from
one slope of a chain or ridge of mountains
are found to yield rich returns to
the gold-seekers, those which descend
from the opposite slope often prove
wholly unproductive. In the Ural,
rich mines occur almost solely on the
eastern, or Siberian slope of the great
chain. On the western, or European
slope, a few inconsiderable mines only
are worked. So, as yet, in the Sierra
Nevada in California, the chief treasures
occur in the feeders of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin rivers,
which descend from its western side.
The eastern slope, which falls towards
the broad arid valley of the Mormons,
is as yet unfamed, and may probably
never prove rich in gold. These circumstances
are accounted for by the
fact that, in the Ural, the older rocks,
of which we have spoken as being
especially gold-bearing, form the eastern
slope of the ridge only, the western
flank of the range being covered for
the most part by rocks of a more
modern epoch. The same may be
the case also with the Sierra Nevada
where it is still unexplored; and the
Utah Lake, though remote, by its
saltness lends probability to this
conjecture.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Fourth</em>, and lastly, they make clear
the distinction between the “dry and
wet diggins” we read of in our Californian
news—why in so many countries
the beds of rivers have been
deserted by the gold-finders, and why
the river banks, and even distant dry
and elevated spots, have proved more
productive than the channel itself.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Let us attempt to realise for a
moment the condition of a country like
California, at the period, not geologically
remote, when the gold-bearing
drift was spread over its magnificent
valley. The whole region was covered
by the sea to an unknown depth.
The snowy ridge, (Nevada,) and probably
the coast ridge, also formed
lines of rocky islands or peaks, which
withstood the fury of the waves,
and, if they were covered with ice,
the wearing and degrading action
also of the moving glaciers. The
spoils of the crumbling rocks sank
into the waters, and were distributed
by tides and currents along the
bottom of the valley. The narrow
opening through the coast chain, by
which the bay of San Francisco now
communicates with the Northern
Pacific, would, at the period we speak
of, prevent the debris of the Nevada
rocks from being washed out into the
main basin of the Pacific, and this
would enable the metallic, as well as
the other spoils of these rocks, to
accumulate in the bottom, and along
the slopes of what is now the valley
of California.</p>

<p class='c010'>By a great physical change the
country was lifted out of the sea,
either at once or by successive stages,
and it presented then the appearance
of a valley long and wide, covered
almost everywhere by a deep clothing
of sands, gravels, and shingles, with
which were intermingled—not without
some degree of method, but at various
depths, and in various proportions—the
lumps and grains of metallic gold
which had formerly existed in the
rocks, of which the sands and shingles
had formed a part.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now the tiny streams, which
had formerly terminated their short
courses in the sea itself, flowed down
the mountain slopes, united their
waters in the bottom, and formed
large rivers. These gradually cut
their way into the superficial sands,
washed them as the modern gold-washer
does in his cradle, and collected,
in certain parts of their beds,
the heavier particles of gold which
they happened to meet with in their
descent. Hence the golden sands of
the Sacramento and the San Joaquin,
and of so many of the rivers celebrated
in ancient story. But the beds of these
rivers could never be the receptacle
of all the gold of such a district. <em>They</em>
derived nearly all their wealth from
the sands and clays or gravels they
had scooped out in forming their channels;
and as these channels occupy
only a small fraction of the surface of
the bottoms and slopes of most river
valleys, they could, or were likely to
contain, only an equally small fraction
of the mineral wealth of their several
regions. The more ancient waters
had distributed the gold throughout
the whole drift of the country. The
river, like a “long Tom,” had cradled
a small part of it, and proved its richness.
The rest of the drift, if rocked
by art, would prove equally, it might
be even more, productive.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is in this old virgin drift, usually
untouched by the river, that the so-called
dry diggings are situated. The
reader will readily understand that,
while no estimate can be formed of
the quantity of gold which an entire
valley like that of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin, or which wide
sandy plains like those of Australia,
may ultimately yield, yet it will
require great sagacity to discover, it
may even be that only accident and
long lapse of time will reveal, in
what spots and at what depths the
gold is most abundantly accumulated,
and where it will best pay the cost of
extraction.</p>

<p class='c010'>We do not now advert to any of
the other points connected with the
history of gold on which our geological
facts throw light. These illustrations
are sufficient to show how rich
in practical inferences and suggestions
geological and chemical science is, in
this as in many other special branches
of mineral inquiry.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor need we say much in answer
to our question,—“Why the ability
to predict, as in the Australian case,”
or generally to draw such conclusions
and offer such suggestions and explanations,
has remained so long
unanswered, or been so lately acquired?
Geology and chemistry are both young
sciences, almost unknown till within
a few years, rapidly advancing, and
every day applying themselves more
widely and directly to those subjects
which effect the material prosperity
and individual comforts of mankind.
Knowledge which was not possessed
before our day, could obviously neither
be applied at all by ancient nations,
nor earlier by the moderns.</p>

<p class='c010'>To the consideration of the absolute
extent and probable productive
durability of the gold regions newly
brought to light—of their extent and
richness compared with those known
in former times—and of their probable
effects on the social and financial
relations of mankind, we shall now
turn our attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the preceding part we have explained
the circumstances in which
gold occurs—the geological conditions
which appear to be necessary to its
occurrence—and where, therefore, we
may expect to find it. But no conditions
chemical or geological at present
known are able to indicate—<em>a
priori</em>, and apart from personal examination
and trial—in what quantity
the precious metal is likely to occur,
either in the living rocks of a gold-bearing
district, or in the sands and
gravels by which it may be covered.
Yet, next to the fact of the existence
of gold in a country, the quantity in
which it is likely to occur, and the
length of time during which a profitable
yield may be obtained, are the
questions which most interest, not
only individuals on the spot, but all
other countries to which the produce of
its mines is usually sent, or from which
adventurers are likely to proceed.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have already remarked, that, in
nearly all the gold regions which have
been celebrated in past times, their
mineral riches have been for the most
part extracted from the drifted sands
and gravels which overspread the
surface. We have also drawn attention
to the small amount of skill and
intelligence which this extraction requires,
and to the brief time in which
such washings may be exhausted even
by ignorant people. Most of our
modern gold mines are situated in
similar drifts. We may instance, from
among the less generally known, those
of Africa, from which are drawn the
supplies that come to us yearly from
the gold coast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of all the African mines those of
Bambouk are supposed to be the richest.
They are about thirty miles south of the
Senegal river; and the inhabitants are
chiefly occupied in gold-washing during
the eight months of dry weather. About
two miles from Natakou is a small round-topped
hill, about 300 feet high, the
whole of which is an alluvial formation
of sand and pulverised emery, with grains
of iron ore and gold, in lumps, grains, and
scales. This hill is worked throughout;
and it is said the richest lumps are
found deepest. There are 1200 pits or
workings, some 40 feet deep—but mere
holes unplanked. This basin includes at
least 500 square miles. Forty miles
north, at the foot of the Tabwara mountains,
are the mines of Semayla, in a hill.
This is of quartz slate; and the gold is
got by pounding the rock in large mortars.
In the river Semayla are alluvial
deposits, containing emery impregnated
with gold. The earth is washed by the
women in calabashes. The mine of
Nambia is in another part of the Tabwara
mountains, in a hillock worked in pits.
The whole gold district of Bambouk is supposed
to extend over 10,000 square miles.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Close to the Ashantee country is that
of the Bunkatoos, who have rich gold
workings, in pits at Bukanti and Kentosoe.”—(<span class='sc'>Wyld</span>,
p. 44.)</p>

<p class='c009'>From this description we see that
all the mines in the Senegal country
are gold-washings, with the exception
of those of Semayla, to which we shall
hereafter allude. No skill is required
to work them; and should European
constitutions ever permit European
nations to obtain an ascendancy in
this part of Africa, such mines may
be effectually exhausted before an
opportunity is afforded for the application
of European skill. And so
in California and Australia, should
the gold repositories be all of the same
easily explored character, the metal
may be suddenly worked out by the
hordes of all classes who have been
rushing in; and thus the influence of
the mines may die away after a few
brief years of extraordinary excitement.</p>

<p class='c010'>When California first became famous,
the popular inquiry everywhere
was simply, what amount of immediate
profit is likely to be realised by an industrious
adventurer? What individual
temptation, in other words, is
there for me or my connections to join
the crowd of eager emigrants?</p>

<p class='c010'>Passing over the inflated and suspicious
recitals which found their way
into American and European journals,
such statements as the following, from
trustworthy sources, could not fail to
have a most stimulating effect—</p>

<p class='c011'>“To give you an instance, however, of
the amount of metal in the soil—which I
had from a miner on the spot, three Englishmen
bought a claim, 30 feet by 100
feet, for fourteen hundred dollars. It
had been twice before bought and sold
for considerable sums, each party who
sold it supposing it to be nearly exhausted.
In three weeks the Englishmen
paid their fourteen hundred dollars,
and cleared thirteen dollars a-day besides
for their trouble. This claim,
which is not an unusually rich one,
though it has perhaps been more successfully
worked, has produced in eighteen
months over twenty thousand dollars,
or five thousand pounds’ worth of
gold.”<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Coke is here describing the
riches of a spot on the immediate
banks of the river, where circumstances
had caused a larger proportion
than usual of that gold to
be collected, or thrown together—which
the river, in cutting out its
gravelly channel, had separated or
<em>rocked out</em>, as we have described in
the previous part of this article.
This rich spot, therefore, is by no
means a fair sample of the country,
though, from Mr Coke’s matter-of-fact
language, many might be led
to think so. Few spots so small in
size could reasonably be expected to
yield so rich a store of gold, though
its accumulation in this spot certainly
does imply that the quantity of gold
diffused through the drift of the country
may in reality be very great. It
may be so, however, and yet not pay
for the labour required to extract it.</p>

<p class='c010'>That many rich prizes have been
obtained by fortunate and steady men
in these diggings, there can be no doubt;
and yet, if we ask what benefit the
emigrant diggers, as a whole, have obtained,
the information we possess
shows it to be far from encouraging.
On this subject we find, in one of the
books before us, the following information:—<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“The inaccessibility of the <em>placers</em>, the
diseases, the hardships, and the <em>very moderate
remuneration resulting to the great
mass of the miners</em>, were quite forgotten or
omitted—in the communications and reports
of a few only excepted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A few have made, and will hereafter
make, fortunes there, and very many of
those who remain long enough will accumulate
something; but the great mass,
all of whom expected to acquire large
amounts of gold in a short time, must be
comparatively disappointed. I visited
California to dig gold, but chose to abandon
that purpose rather than expose life
and health in the mines; and as numbers
were already seeking employment in San
Francisco without success, and I had
neither the means nor the inclination to
speculate, I resolved to return to my
family, and resume my business at home.”—(P.
207.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Thousands, we believe, have followed
Mr Johnson’s example; and thousands
more would have lived longer and
happier, had they been courageous
enough, like him, to return home unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The estimate in a former chapter of
three or four dollars per day per man, as
the average yield during my late visit to
the gold regions, has been most extensively
and generally confirmed since that
period. Innumerable letters, and persons
lately returned from the diggings, (including
successful miners,) now fix the
<em>average at from three to four dollars per
day</em> for each digger during the season.”—(P.
243.)</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thus far the number of successful
men may have been one in every hundred.
In this estimate those only should be considered
successful who have <em>realized and
safely invested their fortunes</em>. The thousands
who thus far have made their fortunes,
but are still immersed in speculations,
do not belong as yet to the foregoing
number.”—(P. 245.)</p>

<p class='c009'>This is applying the just principle,
“Nemo ante obitum beatus,” which
is too generally forgotten when the
first sudden shower of riches falls upon
ourselves or our neighbours.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Individual efforts, as a general rule,
must prove abortive. So far as my
knowledge enables me to judge, they
already have. <em>I do not know of a single
instance of great success at the mines</em> on
the part of a single member of the passengers
or ship’s company with whom I
came round Cape Horn: of the former
there were a hundred, and of the latter
twenty. Many have returned home, who
can tell the truth.”—(P. 249.)</p>

<p class='c009'>This last extract does not contain
Mr Johnson’s own experience, but
that of a physician settled at San
Francisco, from whose communication
he quotes; and the same writer adds
many distressing particulars, which
we pass by, of the fearful misery to
which those free men, of their own
free will, from the thirst of gold, have
cheerfully exposed themselves.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The latest news from Australia
contains a repetition of the Californian
experience. A recent <cite>Australian
and New Zealand Gazette</cite> speaks thus
of the gold-hunters—</p>

<p class='c011'>“In all parts of the colony, labour is
quitting its legitimate employment for
the lottery of gold-hunting; and, as
a natural consequence, industrial produce
is suffering. Abundant as is the metal,
misery among its devotees is quite as
abundant. The haggard look of the
unsuccessful, returning disheartened in
search of ordinary labour, is fully
equalled by the squalor of the successful,
who, the more they get, appear to labour
the harder, amidst filth and deprivation
of every kind, till their wasted frames
vie with those of their less lucky neighbours.
With all its results, gold-finding
is both a body and soul debasing occupation;
and even amongst so small a body
of men, the vices and degradation of
California are being enacted, in spite of
all wholesome check imposed by the
authorities.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is indeed a melancholy reflection
that, wherever such mines of the precious
metals have occurred, there
misery of the most extreme kind has
speedily been witnessed. The cruelties
of the Spanish conquerors towards
the Indian nations of Mexico and
Peru, are familiar to all. They are
now brought back fresh upon our
memories by the new fortunes and
prospects of the western shores of
America. Yet of such cruelties the
Spaniards were not the inventors.
They only imitated in the New, what
thousands of years before the same
thirst for gold had led other conquerers
to do in the Old World.
Diodorus, after mentioning that, in
the confines of Egypt and the neighbouring
countries, there are parts full
of gold mines, from which, by the
labour of a vast multitude of people,
much gold is dug, adds—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The kings of Egypt condemn to these
mines, not only notorious criminals, captives
in war, persons falsely accused, and
those with whom the king is offended,
but also all their kindred and relations.
These are sent to this work, either as a
punishment, or that the profit and gain
of the king may be increased by their
labours. There are thus infinite numbers
thrust into these mines, all bound in
fetters, kept at work night and day, and
so strictly guarded that there is no possibility
of their effecting an escape. They
are guarded by mercenary soldiers of
various barbarous nations, whose language
is foreign to them and to each
other; so that there are no means either
of forming conspiracies, or of corrupting
those who are set to watch them. They
are kept to incessant work by the overseer,
who, besides, lashes them severely.
Not the least care is taken of the bodies
of these poor creatures; they have not a
rag to cover their nakedness; and whosoever
sees them must compassionate
their melancholy and deplorable condition;
for though they may be sick, or
maimed, or lame, no rest, nor any intermission
of labour, is allowed them. Neither
the weakness of old age, nor the infirmity
of females, excuses any from that
work to which all are driven by blows
and cudgels, till at length, borne down by
the intolerable weight of their misery,
many fall dead in the midst of their insufferable
labours. Thus these miserable
creatures, being destitute of all hope,
expect their future days to be worse than
the present, and long for death as more
desirable than life.”<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>How truly might we apply to gold
the words of Horace—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la">Te semper <em>anteit</em> sæva necessitas,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Clavos trabaleis et cuneos manu,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Gestans ahena, nec severus</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la">Uncus abest, liquidumque plumbum.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There was both irony and wisdom
in the counsel given by the Mormon
leaders to their followers after their
settlement on the Salt Lake. “<em>The
true use of gold</em> is for paving streets,
covering houses, making culinary
dishes; and when the saints shall
have preached the gospel, raised
grain, and built up cities enough, the
Lord will open up the way for a supply
of gold to the perfect satisfaction
of his people.” This kept the mass
of their followers from moving to the
diggings of Western California. They
remained around the lake “to be
healthy and happy, to raise grain and
build cities.”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>But the occurrence of individual
disappointment, or misery in procuring
it, will not prevent the gold
itself from afterwards exercising its
natural influence upon society when
it has been brought into the markets
of the world. When the riches of
California began to arrive, therefore,
graver minds, whose thoughts were
turned to the future as much as to the
present, inquired, <em>first</em>, how much gold
are these new diggings sending into
the markets?—and, <em>second</em>, how long
is this yield likely to last?</p>

<p class='c010'><em>1st</em>, To the first of these questions—owing
to the numerous channels along
which the gold of California finds its
way into commerce—it seems impossible
to obtain more than an approximate
answer. Mr Theodore Johnson
(p. 246) estimates the produce for</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1848, at 8 million dollars.</div>
      <div class='line'>1849, from 22 to 37 million dollars.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Or in the latter year, from four to
seven millions sterling. It would, of
course, be more in 1850, as it is
assumed to be by Mr Wyld, from
whose pamphlet (p. 22) we copy the
following table of the estimated total
yield of gold and silver by all the
known mines of the world, in the five
years named in the first column:—</p>

<p class='c010'>Supposing the Russian mines, from
which upwards of four millions’ worth
of the gold of 1848 was derived, to
have remained equally productive in
1850 and 1851, this estimate assigns
a yield of £10,000,000 worth of gold
to California in 1850, and £15,000,000
to California and Australia together
in 1851.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <cite>New York Herald</cite> (October
31st, 1851) estimates the produce of
the Californian mines alone, for the
years 1850 and 1851, at</p>

<p class='c017'>These large returns may be exaggerations,
but they profess to be based
on the custom-house books, and may
be quite as near the truth as the
lower sums of Mr Wyld. But supposing
either statement to contain
only a tolerable guess at the truth,
it may well induce us anxiously to
inquire, in the second place, how long
is such a supply to continue?</p>

<p class='c010'><em>2d</em>, Two different branches of scientific
inquiry must be followed up in
order to arrive at anything like a
satisfactory answer to this second
question. We must investigate both
the probable durability of the surface
diggings, and the probable occurrence
of gold in the native rocks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, the duration of profitable
gold-washing in a region depends,
<em>first</em>, on the extent of country over
which the gold is spread, and the
universality of its diffusion. <em>Second</em>,
on the minimum proportion of gold
in the sands which will pay for washing;
and this, again, on the price of
labour.</p>

<p class='c010'>The valley of the Sacramento and
San Joaquin rivers, in California, is
500 miles long, by an average of 50
miles broad; comprehending an area,
therefore, of 25,000 square miles.</p>

<p class='c010'>We do not know as yet over how
much of this the gold is distributed;
nor whether, after the richest and
most accessible spots have been
hunted out, and apparently exhausted,
the surface of the country generally
will admit of being washed over with
a profit. We cannot draw a conclusion
in reference to this point from
any of the statements yet published
as to the productiveness of particular
spots. But, at the same
time, we ought to bear in mind that
deserted spots may often be returned
to several times, and may yield, to
more careful treatment, and more
skilful methods in after years, returns
of gold not less considerable than
those which were obtained by the
first adventurers. Besides, if we are
to believe Mr Theodore Johnson,</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no reason to doubt that the
whole range of mountains extending
from the cascades in Oregon to the Cordilleras
in South America, contain greater
or less deposits of the precious metals;
and it is well known that <em>Sonora, the
northern state of Mexico, is equally rich
in gold as the adjoining country of Alta
California</em>. The Mexicans have hitherto
proved too feeble to resist the warlike
Apaches in that region, consequently its
treasure remains comparatively undisturbed.”—(P.
231.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Passing by Mr Johnson’s opinion
about the Oregon mountains, what
he says of Sénora has probably a
foundation in truth, and justifies us
in expecting from that region a supply
of gold which may make up for
any falling off in the produce of the
diggings of California for many years
to come.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question as to the minimum
proportion of gold in the sands of
California, or in those of Australia—the
state of society, the workmen and
the tools, in both countries being
much the same—which can be extracted
with a profit, or the minimum
daily yield which will make it worth
extracting, has scarcely as yet become
a practical one.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a matter of curiosity, however,
connected with this subject, it is interesting
to know what is the experience
of other gold regions in these
particulars.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Bohemia, on the lower part of
the river Iser, there were formerly
gold-washings. “The sand does not
now yield more than <em>one grain of
gold in a hundredweight</em>; and it is
supposed that so much is not regularly
to be obtained. There are at
present no people searching for gold,
and there have been none for several
centuries.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a> This, therefore, may be
considered less than the minimum proportion
which will enable washers to
live even in that cheap country. In the
famed gold country of Minas Geraes,
in Brazil, where gangs of slaves are
employed in washing, the net annual
amount of gold extracted seems to
be little more than £4 a-head; and
in Columbia, where provisions are
dearer, “a mine, which employs sixty
slaves, and produces 20 lb. of gold of
18 carats annually, is considered a
good estate.”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>These also approach so near to the
unprofitable point, that gold-washing,
where possible, has long been gradually
giving way, in that country,
to the cultivation of sugar and other
agricultural productions.</p>

<p class='c010'>In regard to Siberia, Rose, in his
account of his visit to the mines of
the Ural and the Altai, gives the
results of numerous determinations
of the proportion of gold in the sands
which are considered worth washing
at the various places he visited.
Thus on the Altai, at Katharinenburg,
near Beresowsk, and at Neiwinskoi,
near Neujansk, and at
Wiluyskoi, near Nischni Tagilsk, the
proportions of gold in 100 poods<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c008'><sup>[15]</sup></a> of
sand, were respectively—</p>

<table class='table1'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c018'>Katharinenburg,</td>
    <td class='c019'>1.1 to 2.5, or an average of 1.3 solotniks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c018'>Neiwinskoi,</td>
    <td class='c019'>½ solotnik.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c018'>Wiluyskoi,</td>
    <td class='c019'>1½ solotnik.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c010'>These are respectively 72, 26, and
80 troy grains to the ton of sand;
and although the proportion of 26
grains to the ton is little more than
is found unworth the extraction from
the sands of the Iser, and implies that
nearly 19 tons of sand must be washed
to obtain one troy ounce of gold, yet
it is found that this washing can in
Siberia be carried on with a profit.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the gold-washings of the Eastern
slopes of the Ural, near Miask, the
average of fourteen mines in 1829 was
about 1⅛ solotniks to the 100 poods,
or 60 grains to the ton of sand. The
productive layers varied in thickness,
from 2 to 10 feet, and were covered
by an equally variable thickness of
sand and gravel, which was too poor
in gold to pay for washing.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c008'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>We have no data, as yet, from
which to judge of the richness of the
Californian and Australian sands,
compared with those of Siberia. And,
if we had, no safe conclusion could be
drawn from them as to the prolonged
productiveness of the mines, in consequence
of another interesting circumstance,
which the prosecution of
the Uralian mines has brought to
light. It is in every country the case
that the richest sands are first washed
out, and thus a gradual falling off in
every locality takes place, till spot by
spot the whole country is deserted by
the washers. We give an example of
this falling off in four of the Ural
mines in five successive years. The
yield of gold is in solotniks from the
100 poods of sand—</p>

<p class='c010'>As all the Ural diggings exhibit
this kind of falling off, it has been
anticipated, from time to time, that
the general and total yield of gold by
the Siberian mines would speedily diminish.
But so far have these expectations
been disappointed, that the
produce has constantly increased from
1829 until now. On an average of
the last five years, the quantity of
gold yielded by the Russian, and
chiefly by the Siberian mines, is now
greater than that obtained from the
South American gold mines in their
richest days.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c008'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>While, therefore, it is certain that
the new American and Australian
diggings will individually, or on each
spot, become poorer year by year, yet,
as in Siberia, the extension of the
search, and the employment of improved
methods, may not only keep up
the yield for a long period of years,
but may augment the yearly supply
even beyond what it has yet been.</p>

<p class='c010'>But while so much uncertainty
attends the consideration of the extent,
richness, and durability of mines
situated in the gold-bearing sands
and gravels, something more precise
and definite can be arrived at in regard
to the gold-bearing rocks. In
nearly all the gold countries of past
times, the chief extraction of the precious
metal, as we have said, has been
from the drifted sands. It is so also
now in Siberia, and it was naturally
expected that the same would be the
case in California. And as other countries
had for a time yielded largely,
and then become exhausted, so it was
predicted of this new region, and it
was too hastily asserted that the increasing
thousands of diggers who were
employed upon its sands must render
pre-eminently shortlived its gold-bearing
capability. This opinion was
based upon the two considerations—<em>first</em>,
that there is no source of reproduction
for these golden sands, inasmuch
as it is only in very rare cases
that existing rivers have brought
down from native rocks the metallic
particles which give their value to the
sands and gravels through which they
flow—and <em>second</em>, that no available
quantity of gold was likely to be found
in any living rocks.</p>

<p class='c010'>But in respect of the living rocks,
two circumstances have been found to
coexist in California, which have not
been observed in any region of gold-washings
hitherto explored, and which
are likely to have much effect on the
special question we are now considering.
These two circumstances are the
occurrence of numerous and, it is said,
extensive deposits of the precious
metals in the solid quartz veins among
the spurs of the Sierra Nevada, and of
apparently inexhaustible beds of the
ores of quicksilver.</p>

<p class='c010'>The discovery of gold in the native
rock was by no means a novelty.
The ancient Egyptians possessed
mines in the Sahara and other neighbouring
mountains. “This soil,”
says Diodorus, “is naturally black;
but in the body of the earth there
are many veins shining with white
marble, (quartz?) and glittering with
all sorts of bright metals, out of
which those appointed to be overseers
cause the gold to be dug by the
labourers—a vast multitude of
people.”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c008'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>At Altenberg also, in Bohemia, in
the middle ages, the mixed metals
(gold and silver) were found in beds
of gneiss;<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c008'><sup>[19]</sup></a> and, at present, in the
Ural and Altai, a small portion of the
gold obtained is extracted from quartz
veins, which penetrate the granite
and other rocks; but these and other
cases, ancient and modern, though
not forgotten, were not considered of
consequence enough to justify the expectation
of finding gold-bearing rocks
of any consequence in California. It
is to another circumstance that we
owe the so early discovery of such
rocks in this new country, and, as in
so many other instances, to a class of
men ignorant of what history relates
in regard to other regions.</p>

<p class='c010'>As early as 1824, the inner country
of North Carolina was discovered to
be productive of gold. The amount
extracted in that year was only
6000 dollars, but it had reached in
1829 to 128,000 dollars. The washings
were extended both east and west,
and finally it was made out that a
gold region girdles the northern part
of Virginia, the two Carolinas, and
Georgia. This region is situated towards
the foot of the mountains, and
where the igneous rocks begin to disturb
and penetrate the primary stratified
deposits. As the sands became
poorer in this region, the ardent
miners had followed up their stream-washings
to the parent rock, and in
veins of rusty quartz had discovered
grains and scales of native gold. To
obtain these, like the Africans at Semayla,
they blasted, crushed, and
washed the rock.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, among the first who, fired by
fresher hopes, pushed to the new
treasure-house in California, came
the experienced gold-seekers from
the Carolinian borders. Following
the gold trail into the gulches and
ravines of the Snowy ridge, some of
them were able to fix their trained
eyes on quartz veins such as they had
seen at home, and, scattered through
the solid rock, to detect sparkling
grains of gold which might long have
escaped less practised observers. And
through the same men, skilled in the
fashion and use of the machinery
found best and simplest for crushing
and separating the gold, the necessary
apparatus was speedily obtained and
set to work to prove the richness of
the new deposits. This richness may
be judged of by the following statements:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some of the chief quartz workings
are in Nevada and Mariposa Counties,
but the best known are on the rancho or
large estate bought by Colonel Fremont
from Alvarado, the Mexican governor.
They are those of Mariposa, Agua Fria,
Nouveau Monde, West Mariposa, and
Ave Maria—the first leased by an American
company, the third by a French, and
the others by English companies. Some
of the quartz has been assayed for £7000
in the ton of rock. A Mariposa specimen
was in the Great Exhibition.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Agua Fria mine was surveyed
and examined by Captain W. A. Jackson,
the well-known engineer of Virginia,
U.S., in October 1850, for which purpose
openings were made by a cross-cut of
sufficient depth to test the size of the
vein and the richness of the ore. The
vein appears to be of a nearly uniform
thickness—of from three and a half to
four and a half feet—and its direction a
few points to the north of east; the inclination
of the vein being 45°. Of the
ore, some specimens were transmitted to
the United States Mint in January 1851;
and the report of the assays then made,
showed that 277 lb. of ore produced 173
oz. of gold—value 3222 dollars, or upwards
of £650 sterling; being at the
rate of £5256 a ton.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The contents of the vein running
through the property, which is about
600 feet in length, and crops out on a
hill rising about 150 to 200 feet above
the level of the Agua Fria Creek, is estimated
at about 18,000 tons of ore to the
water level only; and how far it may
descend below that, is not at present
known.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The West Mariposa mine, under Colonel
Fremont’s lease, has a vein of quartz
which runs the whole length of the allotment,
averages six feet in thickness,
and has been opened in several places.
The assay of Messrs Johnson and Mathey
states that a poor specimen of 11 oz.
9 dwt. 18 grains, produced of gold 2
dwt. 17 grains, which would give £1347
per ton; and a rich specimen, weighing
17 oz. 12 dwt. gave 3 oz. 15 dwt. 9
grains, being at the rate of £24,482 per
ton.”—(<span class='sc'>Wyld</span>, pp. 36–39.)</p>

<p class='c009'>The nature and durability of the
influence which the discovery and
working of these rich veins is likely
to have, depends upon their requiring
capital, and upon their being in the
hands of a limited number of adventurers.
In consequence of this they
cannot be suddenly exhausted, but
may continue to yield a constant
supply for an indefinite number of
years.</p>

<p class='c010'>In connection with the durability
of this supply from the quartz veins—besides
the unsettled question as
to the actual number and extent of
such veins which further exploration
will make out—there is the additional
question as to how deep these veins
will prove rich in gold. Our readers
are probably aware that what are
called veins are walls, more or less
upright, which rise up from an unknown
depth through the beds of rock
which we have described as overlying
each other like the leaves of a book.
This wall generally consists of a
different material from that of which
the rocks themselves consist, and,
where a cliff occurs, penetrated by
such veins, can readily be distinguished
by its colour from the rocks
through which it passes. Now, when
these veins contain metallic minerals,
it has been long observed that, in descending
from the surface, the mineral
value of the vein undergoes important
alterations. Some are rich immediately
under the surface of the ground;
others do not become so till a considerable
depth is reached; while in
others, again, the kind of mineral
changes altogether as we descend.
In Hungary the richest minerals are
met with at a depth of eighty or a
hundred fathoms. In Transylvania,
veins of gold, in descending, become
degraded into veins of lead. In Cornwall,
some of the copper veins increase
in richness the greater the
depth to which the mine is carried;
while others, which have yielded copper
near the surface, have gradually
become rich in tin as the depth increased.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c008'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Now, in regard to the auriferous
quartz veins, it is the result of past
experience that they are often rich
in the upper part, but become poorer
as the explorations are deepened, and
soon cease to pay the expense of
working. In this respect it is just
possible that the Californian veins
may not agree with those of the Ural
and of other regions, though this is a
point which the lapse of years only
can settle. Two things, however, are
in favour of the greater yield of the
Californian veins than those of other
countries in past times—that they
will be explored by a people who
abound in capital, in engineering skill,
and in energy, and that it is now
ascertained that veins may be profitably
rich in gold, though the particles
are too small to be discerned by the
naked eye. Thus, while all the explorations
will be made with skill and
economy, many veins will be mined
into, which in other countries have
been passed over with neglect; and
the extraction of gold from all—but
especially from the poorer sands and
veins—will be aided by the second
circumstance to which we have adverted
as peculiar to California, the
possession of vast stores of quicksilver.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The most important, if not the most
valuable, of the mineral products of this
wonderful country, is its quicksilver.
The localities of several mines of this
metal are already known, but the richest
yet discovered is the one called Forbes’s
mines, about sixty miles from San Francisco,
near San José. Originally discovered
and <em>denounced</em>, according to the
Mexican laws then in force, it fell under
the commercial management of Forbes of
Tepic, who also has some interest in it.
The original owner of the property on
which it is situated, endeavoured to set
aside the validity of the denouncement;
but whether on tenable grounds or otherwise,
I know not. At this mine, by the
employment of a small number of labourers,
and two common iron kettles for
smelting, they have already sold quicksilver
to the amount of 200,000 dollars,
and have now some two hundred tons of
ore awaiting the smelting process. The
cinnabar is said to yield from sixty to
eighty per cent of pure metal, and there
is no doubt that its average product
reaches fifty per cent. The effect of these
immensely rich deposits of quicksilver,
upon the wealth and commerce of the
world, can scarcely be too highly estimated,
provided they are kept from the
clutches of the great monopolists. Not
only will its present usefulness in the
arts be indefinitely extended and increased
by new discoveries of science, but
the extensive mines of gold and silver in
Mexico, Chili, and Peru, hitherto unproductive,
will now be made available by
its application.”—(<span class='sc'>Johnson’s</span> <cite>Sights in the
Gold Region</cite>, p. 201.)</p>

<p class='c009'>By mere washing with water, it is
impossible to extract the finer particles
and scales of gold either from the
natural sand or from the pounded rock.
But an admixture and agitation with
quicksilver licks up and dissolves
every shining speck, and carries it,
with the fluid metal, to the bottom of
the vessel. The amalgam, as it is
called, of gold and quicksilver thus
obtained, when distilled in a close
vessel, yields up its quicksilver again
with little loss, and leaves the pure
gold behind. For the perfect extraction
of the gold, therefore, from its
ores, quicksilver is absolutely necessary,
and it can be performed most
cheaply where the latter metal is
cheapest and most abundant. Hence
the mineral conditions of California
seem specially fitted to make it
an exception to all gold countries
heretofore investigated, or of which
we have any detailed accounts. They
promise it the ability to supply a
large export of gold, probably long
after the remunerative freshness of
the diggings, properly so called,
whether wet or dry, shall have been
worn off.</p>

<p class='c010'>But both the actual yearly produce
of gold, and the probable
permanence of the supply, have
been greatly increased by the still
more recent discoveries in Australia.
A wider field has been opened
up here for speculation and adventure
than North-Western America
in its best days ever presented. We
have already adverted to the circumstances
which preceded and attended
the discovery of gold in this country,
and new research seems daily to add
to the number of districts over which
the precious metal is spread. It is
impossible, however, even to guess
over how much of this vast country
the gold field may extend, and of
richness enough to make washing
possible and profitable. The basin
of the river Murray, in the feeders of
which gold has been found in very
many places, has a mean length from
north to south of 1400 miles, and a
breadth of 400—comprising an area of
from 500,000 to 600,000 square miles.
This is four times the area of California,
and five times that of the
British Islands; but whether the gold
is generally diffused over this wide
area, or whether it is confined to
particular and limited localities, there
has not as yet been time to ascertain.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is chiefly in the head waters or
feeders of the greater streams which
flow through this vast basin that
the metal has hitherto been met
with; but the peculiar physical
character of the creeks, and of the
climate in these regions, suggests the
probability that the search will be
profitably extended downwards along
the entire course of the larger rivers.
Every reader of Australian tours and
travels is aware of the deep and
sudden floods to which the great
rivers of the country are subject, and
of the disastrous inundations to
which the banks of the river Murray
are liable. The lesser creeks or
feeders of this river, in which the
washings are now prosecuted, are
liable to similar visitations. The
Summerhill creek, for example, at
its junction with the Lewis river, is
described as fifty or sixty yards
wide, and the “water as sometimes
rising suddenly twenty feet.” Now,
supposing the gold drift to have been
originally confined to the districts
through which the upper waters of
these rivers flow, the effect of such
floods, repeated year by year, must
have been to wash out from their
banks and bottoms, and to diffuse
along the lower parts of their channels,
or of the valleys they flooded, the
lighter portions, at least, of metallic
riches in which the upper country
abounded. The larger particles or
lumps may have remained higher up:
but all that the force of a deep stream
in its sudden flood could carry down,
may be expected among the sands
and gravels, and in the wider river
beds, and occasionally flooded tracts
of the lower country. In other
words, there is reason to believe that
from its head waters on the western
slopes of the Australian Alps, to its
mouth at Adelaide, the Murray will
be found to some degree productive
in gold, and more or less remunerative
to future diggers.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there is in reality no reason
to believe that the gold of the great
Australian basin was ever confined—at
least since the region became
covered with drift—to the immediate
neighbourhood of the mountains, or
to the valleys through which its
mountain streams pursue their way.
We have already fully explained
that it is not to the action of existing
rivers on the native gold-bearing
rocks of the mountain, that the
presence of the precious metal in
their sands is generally due, but to
that of numerous degrading causes,
operating simultaneously and at a more
ancient period, when the whole valley
was covered deep with water. By
these, the debris of the mountains
here, as in California, must have been
spread more or less uniformly over
the entire western plain. This vast
area, therefore, comprehending so
many thousand square miles, may,
through all its drifted sands and
gravels, be impregnated with metallic
particles. Dry diggings, consequently,
may be hereafter opened at great
distances from the banks of existing
streams. Time alone, in fact, can
tell over how much of this extensive
region it will pay the adventurer to
dig and wash the wide-spread depths
of drift.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then there is the province of Victoria,
south of the Australian Alps,
in which gold is described as most
plentiful. The streams which descend
from the southern slope of
these mountains are numerous, in
consequence of the peculiarly large
quantity of rain which falls on this
part of Australia,<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c008'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and over a breadth
of 200 miles they are represented as
all rich in gold. And besides, the country
east of the meridian chain, between
Bathurst and the sea, and all the
still unknown portion of the Australian
continent, have yet to add their
stores to those of Victoria and of
the basin of the Murray. And though
we do not know to what extent quartz
veins prevail in the mountains of New
South Wales, we have authentic
statements as to their existence not
very remote from Bathurst, and as
to their being rich in gold. Here
also, therefore, as in California, there
may be a permanent source of gold
supply, which may continue to yield,
after the washings have ceased to be
greatly remunerative—which may
even augment in productiveness as
that of the sands declines. On the
whole, then, although it is impossible
to form any estimate of the
actual amount of gold which year by
year the great new mining fields are
destined to supply to the markets of
the world, yet we think two deductions
may be assumed as perfectly
certain from the facts we have stated—<em>first</em>,
that the average annual supply
for the next ten years is likely to be
greater than it ever was since the
commencement of authentic history—and
<em>second</em>, that the supply, though
the washings fall off, will be kept up
for an indefinite period, by the exploration
of the gold-bearing quartz
veins in Australia and America.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the table we have copied from
Mr Wyld, the produce of gold for
1851 is estimated—guessed is a better
word—at £22,500,000. Advices from
Melbourne to the 22d of December
state that the receipts of gold in that
place in a single day had amounted
to 16,333 ounces—that the total produce
of the Ballarat and Mount
Alexander diggings, from their discovery
on the 29th September to the
17th of December, two months and
a half, had been 243,414 ounces,
valued at £730,242—that from
twenty thousand to thirty thousand
persons were employed at the diggings—and
that the auriferous
grounds, already known, which can
be profitably worked, cannot be dug
for years to come “by any number of
people that can by possibility reach
them.” Those from Sydney calculate
the export from that place to have
been at the rate of three millions
sterling a-year; while the report of
the  Government  Commissioners,
“On the extent and capability of
the mines in New South Wales,”
gives it as their unanimous opinion,
that they offer a “highly remunerative
employment to at least a hundred
thousand persons—four times
the number now employed.” With
these data, there appears no exaggeration
in the estimate now made in
the colony, that the yearly export of
gold will not be less than seven or
eight millions sterling.  With this
more accurate knowledge of the capabilities
of Australia than was possessed
when Mr Wyld’s estimate was
made, and with the hopes and rumours
that exist as to other new
sources of supply, are we wrong in
guessing that the total produce of
gold alone, for the present and some
succeeding years, cannot be less than
£25,000,000 to £30,000,000 sterling?
What was the largest yield of the
most fruitful mines in ancient times
compared with this? The annual product
of the ancient Egyptian mines of
gold and silver is said by Herodotus
to have been inscribed on the walls of
the palace of the ancient kings at
Thebes, and the sum, as he states it
in Grecian money, was equal to six
millions sterling! This Jacob<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c008'><sup>[22]</sup></a> considers
to be a gross exaggeration;
but he believes, nevertheless, that
“the produce of the mines of that
country, together with that of the other
countries whose gold and silver was
deposited there, far exceeded the quantity
drawn from all the mines of the
then known world in subsequent ages,
down to the discovery of America.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And what did America yield after
the discovery by Columbus, (1492,)
and the triumphs of Cortes and
Pizarro? Humboldt estimates the
annual yield of gold, from the plunder
of the people and from the mines
united—</p>

</table>

<p class='c017'>And from the discovery of the silver
mine of Potosi in 1545, to the end of
the century, the produce of silver and
gold together was about £2,100,000
from America; and from America and
Europe together, £2,250,000 a-year.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again, during the eighteenth century,
the yearly produce of the precious
metals—gold and silver together—obtained
from the mines of Europe,
Africa, and America, is estimated by
Mr Jacob (ii. p. 167) at £8,000,000;
and for the twenty years previous to
1830, at about £5,000,000 sterling.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c008'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
And although the greatly enlarged
produce of the Russian mines, in gold
especially, has come in to make up for
the failure or stoppage of the American
mines since 1800, yet what does
the largest of all past yields of gold
amount to, compared with the quadrupled
or quintupled supply there seems
now fair and reasonable grounds for
expecting?</p>

<p class='c010'>And what are to be the consequences
of the greatly augmented
supply of gold which these countries
promise? Among the first will be to
provoke and stimulate the mining
industry of other countries to new
activity and new researches; and thus,
by a natural reaction, to add additional
intensity to the cause of change.
Such was the effect of the discovery
of America upon mining in Europe,
and especially in Germany. “In fourteen
years after 1516, not less than
twenty-five noble veins were discovered
in Joachimsthal in Bohemia,
and in sixty years they yielded
1,250,000 marcs of silver.”<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c008'><sup>[24]</sup></a> And,</p>

<p class='c011'>“The discovery of America, and of
the mines it contained,” says Mr Jacob,
“seems to have kindled a most vehement
passion for exploring the bowels of the
earth in search of gold in most of the
countries of Europe, but in no part of it
to so great an extent as in the Bishopric
of Salzburg. The inhabitants of that
country seemed to think themselves within
reach of the Apple of the Hesperides
and of the Golden Fleece, and about to
find in their streams the Pactolus of
antiquity. Between the years 1538 and
1562,<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c008'><sup>[25]</sup></a> more than a thousand leases of
mines were taken. The greatest activity
prevailed, and one or two large fortunes
were made.”—(<span class='sc'>Jacob</span>, i. p. 250.)</p>

<p class='c009'>This impulse has already been felt
as the consequence of recent discovery.
The New York papers have
just announced the discovery of new
deposits of gold in Virginia, “equal
to the richest in California;” in
Queen Charlotte’s Island gold is said
to have been found in great abundance;
in New Caledonia and New
Zealand it is spoken of; and the research
after the precious metal is at
the present moment propagating itself
throughout the civilised world. And
that the activity thus awakened is
likely to be rewarded by many new
discoveries, and by larger returns in
old localities, will appear certain,
when we consider, <em>first</em>, that the
geological position and history of
gold-producing regions is far better
understood now than it ever was
before; <em>second</em>, that the value of
quartz veins, previously under-estimated,
has been established by the
Californian explorations, and must
lead in other countries to new researches
and new trials; <em>thirdly</em>, that
the increased supply of quicksilver
which California promises may call
into new life hosts of deserted mines
in Southern America and elsewhere;
and, <em>lastly</em>, that improved methods of
extraction, which the progress of
chemical science is daily supplying,
are rendering profitable the poorer
mines which in past days it was
found necessary to abandon.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the end of the seventeenth
century the reduction in the price of
quicksilver, consequent on the supplies
drawn from the mines of Idria, greatly
aided the mines of Mexico, (Jacob,
ii. p. 153;) and of the effects of better
methods Rose gives the following
illustrations, in his description of the
celebrated Schlangenberg mine in
Siberia:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“At first, ores containing only four
solotniks of silver were considered unfit
for smelting, and were employed in the
mines for filling up the waste. These
have long already been taken out, and
replaced by poorer ores, which in their
turn will probably by-and-by be replaced
by still poorer.”—“The ancient inhabitants
washed out the gold from the
ochre of these mines, as is evident from
the heaps of refuse which remain on the
banks of the river Smejewka. This
refuse has been found rich enough in gold
to pay for washing and extracting anew.”<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c008'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The history of all mining districts,
and of all smelting and refining processes,<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c008'><sup>[27]</sup></a>
present us with similar facts;
and the aspects of applied science, in
our day, are rich in their promise of
such improvements for the future. If,
therefore, to all the considerations we
have presented we add those from
which writers like M’Culloch<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c008'><sup>[28]</sup></a> had
previously anticipated an increased
supply of the precious metals—such
as the pacification of Southern America,
and the application of new
energy to the mines of that country,
and probably under the direction of
a new race—the calmest and coolest
of our readers will, we think, coincide
with us in anticipating from <em>old</em>
sources, as well as from <em>new</em>, an
increased and prolonged production
of the precious metals.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the social and political consequences
of these discoveries, the most
striking and attractive are those
which are likely to be manifested in
the immediate neighbourhood—using
the word in a large sense—of the
countries in which the new gold
mines have been met with. The
peopling of California and Australia—the
development of the boundless
traffic which Western America and
the islands of the Australasian, Indian,
and Chinese seas are fitted to support—the
annexation of the Sandwich
Islands(!)—the establishment of new
and independent dominions on the
great islands to the south and west—the
throng of great ships and
vessels of war we can in anticipation
see dotting and over-awing the broad
Pacific—the influence, political and
social, of these new nations on the
old dominions and civilisation of the
fabled East, and of still mysterious
China and hidden Japan;—we may
almost speak of this <em>forward</em> vision,
as Playfair has written of the effect
upon his mind of Hutton’s expositions
of the <em>past</em>—“The mind seemed
to grow giddy by looking so far back
into the abyss of time; and while we
listened with earnestness and admiration
to the philosopher, who was now
unfolding to us the order and series
of these wonderful events, we became
sensible <em>how much further reason may
sometimes go than imagination can
venture to follow</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But its influence, though less
dazzling, will be as deep and perceptible
upon the social relations of the
older monarchies of Europe. Our
own richly commercial and famed
agricultural country, and its dependencies,
will be especially affected.
Prices will nominally rise—commerce
and general industry will be stimulated—and
a gilding of apparent
prosperity will overspread class interests,
which would otherwise languish
and decline. How far this is likely
to be favourable to the country, on
the whole—to interfere with, disguise,
or modify the effect of party measures—we
have recently discussed in previous
articles, and shall for the present
pass by.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps that portion of its influence
which, in this country of great money
fortunes, and in some of the Continental
states, is attracting most
attention, is the change likely to be
produced by it in the bullion market,
especially in the relative values of
gold and silver, and even (should this
not materially alter, in consequence
of an enlarged produce from the silver
mines) in the real value of annuities,
stock, and bonds of every description.
It has occasionally happened in
ancient times, that by a sudden large
influx of gold the comparative value
of that metal has been lowered in an
extraordinary degree. Thus Strabo,
in his <cite>Geography</cite>, (book iv. chap. vi.
sect. 9,) has the following passage:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Polybius relates that, in his time,
mines of gold were found among the
Taurisci Norici, in the neighbourhood of
Aquilea, so rich that, in digging to the
depth of two feet only, gold was met
with, and that the ordinary sinkings did
not exceed fifteen feet; that part of it
was in the form of native gold, in pieces
as large as a bean or a lupin, which lost
only one-eighth in the fire; and that the
rest, though requiring more purification,
gave a considerable product; that some
Italians, having associated themselves
with the barbarians to work the mines,
<em>in the space of two months the price of
gold fell one-third throughout the whole of
Italy</em>; and that the Taurisci, having seen
this, expelled their foreign partners, and
sold the metal themselves.”<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c008'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Were anything of this nature to
happen—though very far less in degree—as
a consequence of the recent
discoveries, it could not fail to produce
a serious monetary revolution,
and much pecuniary distress, both
individual and general, which the
wisest legislation could neither wholly
prevent nor remove. Such a sudden
and extreme effect many have actually
anticipated from them, and measures
have, in consequence, been taken,
even by Continental governments,
such as are detailed in the following
passage from Mr Wyld’s pamphlet:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Among the many extraordinary incidents
connected with the Californian discoveries,
was the alarm communicated to
many classes, which was not confined to
individuals, but invaded governments.
The first announcement spread alarm;
but, as the cargoes of gold rose from a
hundred thousand dollars to a million,
bankers and financiers began seriously
to prepare for an expected crisis. In
England and the United States the panic
was confined to a few; but, on the Continent
of Europe, every government, rich
and poor, thought it needful to make
provision against the threatened evils.
The governments of France, Holland, and
Russia, in particular, turned their attention
to the monetary question; and, in
1850, the government of Holland availed
itself of a law, which had not before been
put in operation, to take immediate steps
for selling off the gold in the banks of
Amsterdam, at what they supposed to be
the then highest prices, and to stock
themselves with silver. This operation
was carried on concurrently with a supply
of bullion to Russia for a loan, a demand
for silver in Austria, and for shipment to
India; and it did really produce an effect
on the silver market.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The particular way in which the
Netherlands operations were carried out
was especially calculated to produce the
greatest disturbance of prices. The ten-florin
gold pieces were sent to Paris,
coined there into napoleons, and silver
five-franc pieces drawn out in their place.
At Paris, the premium on gold, in a few
months, fell from nearly two per cent to a
discount, and at Hamburg a like fall took
place. In London, the great silver market,
silver rose between the autumn and
the New Year, from 5s. per oz. to 5s. 1⅝d.
per oz., and Mexican dollars from
4s. 10½d. to 4s. 11⅝d. per oz.; nor did
prices recover until towards the end of
the year 1851, when the fall was as
sudden as the rise.”—(<span class='sc'>Wyld</span>, pp. 20, 21.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, without identifying ourselves
with any unreasonable fears, or partaking
of the alarms occasionally expressed,
either at home or abroad,
we cannot shut our eyes to the certainty
of a serious amount of influence
being exercised upon monetary
and financial affairs, by a long continuance
of the increased supplies of
gold which are now pouring into the
European and American markets.
We concede all that can fairly be
demanded, in the way of increased
supply—to meet the wants of the new
commerce springing up in the Pacific
and adjacent seas—to allow of the
increased coinage which the new
States in North America, and the
growing population of our own colonies
require—to make up for the
extending use of gold and silver in
articles of luxury which increasing
wealth and improving arts must occasion—to
restore the losses from hoarding,
from shipwreck, from wear and
tear of coin, and the thousand other
causes of waste—and to admit of the
large yearly storing of coin for the purposes
of emigration: all that can fairly
be demanded to meet these and other
exigencies we admit; and yet there
will still, at the present rate of yield,
be a large annual surplus, which must
gradually cheapen gold in the market.
There are no data upon which we can
base any calculations as to the yearly
consumption of gold alone for all
these purposes; but estimates have
been made by Humboldt, Jacob, and
M’Culloch, of the probable consumption
of gold and silver together, up
to a very recent period. The latter
author disposes of the annual supply
of the metals—estimated at nine millions
before the recent discoveries—in
the following manner:—</p>

<table class='table1'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c003'>Consumption in the arts in Europe and America,</td>
    <td class='c004'>£4,840,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c003'>Exportation to Australia and India,</td>
    <td class='c004'>2,600,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c003'>Waste of coin (at 1 per cent,)</td>
    <td class='c004'>1,600,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c003'>&#160;</td>
    <td class='c004'><hr></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c015'>Making together,</td>
    <td class='c004'>£9,040,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c017'>which was very nearly the supposed
yield of all known mines, when Mr
M’Culloch’s estimate was made. If
we add a half to all these items—as
we conceive a very liberal allowance—we
shall have a round sum of thirteen
and a half millions sterling of
gold and silver together, as sufficient
to supply all the wants of increasing
use in the arts, waste in coinage,
extending commerce, colonial settlement,
State extension, and Eastern
exportation. But the actual produce</p>
<table class='table1'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c003'>for 1851 is estimated at</td>
    <td class='c004'>£30,000,000</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='c003'>and if we deduct</td>
    <td class='c004'>13,500,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c003'>&#160;</td>
    <td class='c004'><hr></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c003'>there remains a balance of</td>
    <td class='c004'>£16,500,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class='c017'>—irrespective
of all increase which is
likely to be caused by the extension
of the Australian gold field, and by
the operation of the various other
causes we have adverted to in the
present article. This surplus also
will consist chiefly of gold; so that
whatever interest may otherwise attach
to the curious fact stated by Mr
Wyld, it is clear that his conclusion
is premature, that no alteration is to
be looked for in the relative market
values of the two precious metals.
Only a greatly increased activity and
produce in the silver mines can prevent
it.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, independent of the question as
between the two metals, there remains
as certain the influence of the surplus
gold supply upon the general bullion
and other markets. The immediate
demands, or actual outlets for increased
coinage, may for a few years
absorb even this large surplus, but its
final action in lowering the comparative
value of gold, and in altering
nominal prices and values generally,
cannot be reasonably doubted.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>LIFE OF NIEBUHR.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c008'><sup>[30]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The name of Niebuhr is so inveterately
associated with certain
profound discussions in historical
criticism, that we must beg our readers
to read twice over the notice at
the foot of our page, in order to
assure themselves that it is not the
History of Rome, but the Life of its
author, that we are about to bring
before their attention. We shall
hardly, perhaps, be able to abstain
from some glance at that method of
historical criticism so justly connected
with the name of Niebuhr, but it is
the life and personal character of the
man which will occupy us on the
present occasion.</p>

<p class='c010'>One observation on that historical
criticism we will at once permit ourselves
to make, because it has a
distinct bearing upon the intellectual
character of Niebuhr, as well as on
the peculiarities of his historical
work. The distinguishing character
of that school of historical criticism,
of which he may be considered the
founder, is not its scepticism, for it
was no new thing to doubt of the
extraordinary events related of the
early periods of Roman, or of any other
history. There have been always
people sceptically disposed. Our
David Hume could very calmly give
it as his opinion that true history
begins with the first page of Thucydides.
It was nothing new, therefore,
to disturb our faith in the earlier
portions of the Roman history, or to
pronounce them to be fables. The
novelty lay in the higher and more
patient and more philosophical manner
in which those fables were investigated,
and their origin, and their
true place and connection with history,
determined. The elder sceptic,
having satisfied himself that a narrative
was fabulous, threw it aside:
the modern critic follows the spirit,
the life of the nation, into the fable
itself. He does not attempt, as the
half-doubting, half-believing historian
has done, to shape it at once to the
measure of modern credence, by
merely modifying a few of the details,
reducing an extravagance, or lopping
off a miracle; but, taking his stand
on whatever facts remain indisputable,
or whatever knowledge may be obtained
from collateral sources, he investigates
thoroughly the fabulous or
poetic narrative. He endeavours to
transport himself into the times when
men thought after a poetic fashion—or,
at all events, when pleasure and
excitement, not accuracy and instruction,
were the objects they aimed at;
he labours to form an estimate of the
circumstances that kindled their imagination,
to show <em>how the fable grew</em>,
and thus to extract from it, in every
sense of the word, its full historical
significance.</p>

<p class='c010'>How difficult such a task, and how
precarious, after all, the result of such
labours, we must leave at present to
the reflection of our readers. What
we have here to observe is, that such
a method of historical criticism is not
to be pursued by a mind stored only
with dry erudition, or gifted only
with the faculty of withholding its
belief. Such store of erudition is indispensable,
but it must be combined
with that strong power of imagination
which can recall into one vivid
picture the scattered knowledge gained
from many books, and which enables
its possessor to live in the scenes
and in the minds of the bygone ages
of humanity. Accordingly, it is this
combination of ardent imagination
with most multifarious erudition that
we meet with in Niebuhr; and it is
not the life of a dry pedant, or of one
of cold sceptical understanding, or of
a mere philologer, that we have here
presented to us.</p>

<p class='c010'>These two volumes are extremely
entertaining. They are chiefly composed
of the letters of Niebuhr; nor
do we remember to have ever encountered
a series of letters of more unflagging
interest. This interest they
owe in great measure to the strongly-marked
personal character of the
writer. They are not only good letters,
containing always something
that suggests reflection, but they
sustain their biographical or dramatic
character throughout. It ought to
be added, too, that they are most
agreeably translated. The work has
been altogether judiciously planned,
and ably executed. A candid and
explicit preface at once informs us of
the sources from which it is derived;
we are forewarned that many materials
requisite to a complete life of
Niebuhr still remain inaccessible;
meanwhile, what is here presented to
us bears an authentic stamp, and
appears, as matters stand, to be the
best biography that could be given to
the English public. Of the merits of
Niebuhr himself the author has preferred
that others should speak. He
has chosen almost entirely to restrict
himself within the modest province of
the translator or the editor. Into the
motives of this reticence we have no
business to pry: whatever is done, is
done well; whatever is promised is
ably performed. A book professing
to be the Life of Niebuhr will excite
some expectations which this publication
will not satisfy; but when an
author limits himself to a distinct
and serviceable task, and performs
that task well, he is entitled to our
unreserved thanks, and to our simple
commendation, unmixed with any
murmur of complaint.</p>

<p class='c010'>Interesting as we have found this
book, still the perusal of two compact
octavo volumes may deter some readers
who might desire, at a rather less
cost of time, to obtain an insight into
the life and character of Niebuhr.
To such readers the following abbreviated
sketch may not be unacceptable.
We must premise that the
present work is founded on a memoir
of Niebuhr published by his sister-in-law,
Madame Hensler. This consists
of a series of his letters divided into
sections, each section being preceded
by such biographical notice as was
necessary to their explanation. The
English author has retained this arrangement,
adding, however, considerably
to the narrative of Madame
Hensler from other authentic sources,
and omitting such of the letters as he
judged might be devoid of interest.
Nearly one-half of these, we are told,
have been omitted—chiefly on the
ground that they were on learned
subjects, and might detract from the
interest of the biography. We have
no doubt that a sound discretion has
been exercised on this point; nevertheless
we trust that these two
volumes will meet with sufficient encouragement
to induce the author to
publish that third volume at which he
hints, and which is to contain “the
letters referred to, together with the
most valuable portions of his smaller
writings.” We sincerely hope that
one who has performed this task so
well will continue to render the same
good services to the English public.
The arrangement we have alluded to—that
of letters divided into sections,
with a biographical notice at the head
of each, sufficient to carry us over the
ensuing section—seems to us very
preferable to the ordinary plan of our
memoir writers, who attach the explanatory
notice to each separate
letter. Under this last plan, one
never settles down fairly to <em>letter-reading</em>.
We cannot, of course, in
the following sketch, retain the advantages
of this arrangement, but
must put together our facts and our
quotations in the best order we can.</p>

<p class='c010'>Idle and cursory readers, who have
only heard or thought of Niebuhr as
the provoking destroyer of some
agreeable fictions—as the ruthless
enemy of poetic and traditionary lore—will
be surprised to find what a
deep earnestness of conviction there
was in this man, and how his enthusiasm
for truth and for all virtue
rises into romance. Once for all, let
no man parade his love of poetry,
with the least hope of being respected
for it, who has not a still greater love
of truth. Nay, if we reflect patiently
and calmly upon this matter, we shall
find that there is but one way to keep
this flower of poesy in perennial
bloom—it is to see that the waters of
truth are flowing free and clear
around it. We may be quite sure
that to whatever level this stream,
by its own vital force, shall rise or
sink, the same fair lily will be seen
floating just on the surface of it.
Just where these waters lie open to
the light of heaven, do we find this
beautiful creation looking up from
them into the sky.</p>

<p class='c010'>The scene and circumstances
amongst which the childhood of Niebuhr
was passed, appear to us to be
singularly in accordance with the
future development and character of
the man. They were favourable to
concentration of thought, and to an
independent, self-relying spirit; they
were favourable to the exercise of an
imagination which was fed continually
by objects remote from the senses,
and by knowledge obtained from
books, or else from conversation with
his father, who was both a learned
man and a great traveller. If nature,
in one of her freaks—or, let us say, if
some German fairies, of an erudite
species, had resolved to breed a great
scholar, who should be an independent
thinker—who should be devoted
to books, yet retain a spirit of self-reliance—who
should have all the
learning of colleges without their
pedantry, and read through whole
libraries, and yet retain his free, unfettered
right of judgment—how would
they have proceeded to execute their
project? Would they have thrown
their little pupil at the feet of some
learned professor at Bonn or Göttingen?
Not at all. They would have
carried their changeling into some wild
tract of country, shut him up there
with his books, and given him for his
father a linguist and a traveller. They
would have provided for him just
those circumstances into which young
Niebuhr was thrown. His childish
imagination was no sooner kindled
than he found himself wandering in
all quarters of the globe, and listening
to the stories of the most remote ages.</p>

<p class='c010'>This father of our historian—Carsten
Niebuhr—was himself a remarkable
man; full of energy, of great
perseverance, and of strong feelings.
He had been one of five travellers
despatched by the Danish Government
on an expedition of discovery
into the East. In crossing the deserts
of Arabia, his four companions sank
under the hardships and calamities
they encountered. This was in the
first year of their journey; nevertheless,
he pursued his way alone, and
spent six years in exploring the East.
He had returned to Copenhagen, and
“was on the point,” says our biography,
“of undertaking a journey into
the interior of Africa, when he fell in
love with a young orphan lady, the
daughter of the late physician to the
King of Denmark.” He gives up
Africa, and all the world of travel
and discovery, for this “young orphan
lady;” and a few years after his marriage,
we find him settled down at
Meldorf, as <i><span lang="de">land-schreiber</span></i> to the province
of South Dithmarsh—a civil
post, whose duties seem chiefly to
have concerned the revenues of the
province.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Meldorf is a little, decayed,
antiquated town, not without its traditions
of municipal privileges; and
Dithmarsh is what its name suggests
to an English ear—an open marshy
district, without hills or trees, with
nothing but the general sky, which
we all happily share in, to give it any
beauty. One figures to one’s self the
traveller, who had been exploring the
sunny regions of the East, or who
had been living at Copenhagen, in
the society of scholars and of statesmen,
retiring, with his young orphan
lady, to this dreary Dithmarsh, peopled
only by peasantry. Even the
high-road runs miles off from his habitation,
so that no chance can favour
him, and no passing or belated traveller
rests at his door. He occupies
his spare hours in building himself a
house; in which operation there is
one little fellow standing by who
takes infinite delight. This is our
Barthold George Niebuhr, who had
been born in Copenhagen on the 27th
of August 1776. He and an elder
sister will be principal inhabitants of
the new house when it is built, and
their education be the chief care and
occupation of the traveller.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barthold is in his sixth or seventh
year when his father writes thus of
him:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“He studied the Greek alphabet only
for a single day, and had no further
trouble with it: he did it with very little
help from me. The boy gets on wonderfully.
Boje says he does not know his
equal; but he requires to be managed in
a peculiar way. May God preserve our
lives, and give us grace to manage him
aright! Oh if he could but learn to control
the warmth of his temper—I believe
I might say his pride! He is no longer
so passionate with his sister: but if he
stumbles in the least in repeating his
lessons, or if his scribblings are alluded
to, he fires up instantly. He cannot
bear to be praised for them; because he
believes he does not deserve it. In short,
I repeat it, he is proud; he wants to
know everything, and is angry if he does
not know it.... My wife complains
that I find fault with Barthold unnecessarily.
I did not mean to do so. He is
an extraordinarily good little fellow; but
he must be managed in an extraordinary
way; and I pray God to give me wisdom
and patience to educate him properly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here we have “his picture in little;”
the wonderful quickness and application,
the extreme conscientiousness,
and the warmth of temper which distinguished
the man Niebuhr through
his career. But who is this Boje, who
says “he does not know his equal?”
And how happens it that there is any
one in Meldorf—a place, we are told,
quite destitute of literary society—who
is entitled to give an opinion on the
subject? This Boje was ex-editor of
the <cite>Deutsches Museum</cite>, and translator,
we believe, of Walter Scott’s novels;
and has been lately appointed prefect
of the province. His coming is a
great event to the Niebuhrs, a valuable
acquisition to their society, and
of especial importance to young Barthold;
for Boje has “an extensive
library, particularly rich in English
and French, as well as German books,”
to which library our youthful and indefatigable
student is allowed free
access. French and English he has,
from a very early age, been learning
from his father and mother. Are we
not right in saying, that no Teutonic
fairies could have done better for their
pupil? By way of nursery tale, his
father amuses him with strange accounts
of Eastern countries, of the
Turks, of sultans, of Mahomet and the
caliphs. He is already a politician.
“He had an imaginary empire called
Low-England, of which he drew maps,
and he promulgated laws, waged wars,
and made treaties of peace there.”
Then comes Boje to give him his first
lesson upon <em>myths</em>. The literary prefect
of Dithmarsh, writing to a friend,
says:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“This reminds me of little Niebuhr.
His docility, his industry, his devoted
love for me, procure me many a pleasant
hour. A short time back, I was reading
<cite>Macbeth</cite> aloud to his parents, without
taking any notice of him, till I saw what
an impression it made on him. Then I
tried to render it intelligible to him, and
even explained to him how the witches
were only poetical beings. When I was
gone, he sat down, (he is not yet seven
years old,) and wrote it all out on seven
sheets of paper, without omitting one important
point, and certainly without any
expectation of receiving praise for it;
for, when his father asked to see what he
had written, and showed it to me, he
cried for fear he had not done it well.
Since then, he writes down everything of
importance that he hears from his father
or me. We seldom praise him, but just
quietly tell him when he has made any
mistake, and he avoids the fault for the
future.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Very surprising accounts are given
of the boy’s precocious sagacity in
picturing to himself a historic scene,
with all its details, or following out
the probable course of events. These
accounts are rather <em>too</em> surprising.
When the war broke out in Turkey,
it so excited his imagination that he
not only dreamt of it, but anticipated
in his dreams, and we suppose also
in his waking hours, the current of
events. His notions were so just,
and his knowledge of the country, and
the situations of the towns, so accurate,
that, we are told, “the realisation
of his nightly anticipations generally
appeared in the journals a short
time afterwards.” One would say
that the fairies had indeed been with
him. Madame Hensler’s narrative
partakes here, in some measure, of
that marvellous character which accompanies
family traditions of all
kinds, whether of the Roman <i><span lang="la">gens</span></i> or
the Danish household. But on other
occasions, and from Niebuhr’s own
words, we learn that, owing to his
minute knowledge, his most tenacious
memory, and his vivid imagination,
he, at a very early time, manifested
that spirit of quite philosophical divination
which led him to his discoveries
in Roman history. We say quite
philosophical divination; for we do
not suppose that Niebuhr claimed for
himself, or his friends for him, any
mysterious intuition into the course
of events; but there is occasionally,
both in the memoir and in the letters,
a vagueness of expression on this
subject which might lead to misapprehension,
and which one wishes had
been avoided.</p>

<p class='c010'>We must now follow this precocious
pupil to the University at Kiel. A
lad of seventeen, we find him already
a companion for professors. Writing
home to his parents, he says of Dr
Hensler:—“My ideas about the origin
of the Greek tribes, the history of
the colonisation of the Greek cities,
and my notions in general about the
earliest migration from west to east,
are new to him; and he thinks it
probable that they may be correct.
He exhorts me to work them out,
and bring them into as clear a form
as I can.” Meanwhile, he is to be
occupied, heart and soul, in studying
metaphysics under Reinhold, one of
the most celebrated disciples of Kant.
To enumerate the studies in which
he is alternately engaged, would be
to pass in review the whole series of
subjects which are taught in a university;
just as, at a somewhat later
period, to enumerate all the languages
which he had learnt, would be simply
to name in order every language
which a European scholar, by the
aid of grammar and dictionary, could
learn. His father, with a very excusable
pride, makes out, in one of his
letters, a list of his son’s attainments
of this kind: he was, more or less,
master of some twenty languages.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this philologist, however, there
was no want of poetic feeling or vivid
imagination. When reading the
ancients, he completely lived in their
world and with them. He once told
a friend who had called on him and
found him in great emotion, that he
often could not bear to read more
than a few pages at a time in the old
tragic poets; he realised so vividly
all that was said, and done, and
suffered. “He could see Antigone
leading her blind father—the aged
Œdipus entering the grove—he could
catch the music of their speech.”
Neither in this youth, so stored, so
fed with books, was there any deadness
of heart towards the living
friend. We have some letters full of
a painful sensitiveness at the apprehension
that his correspondent had
forgotten or grown cold towards him.
The gravest fault in his character was
too quick a temper; but if this led
him to take offence unjustly, he was
always sufficiently just and generous
to seek for reconciliation. Least of
all had his erudition or his erudite
labours quenched the moral enthusiasm
of his nature. From childhood
up to manhood, from manhood
to his latest day, the same high sense
of moral rectitude pervaded all his
judgments, and influenced all his
actions. The same boy who would
not receive praise if he did not think
he deserved it, in after years would
not draw a salary if he did not think
it was rigidly earned, nor accept a present
even from a municipality—from
the city of Geneva—for rendering a
service which he had spontaneously
performed. At the university of
Kiel we find him breaking with an
intimate friend, and much to his own
regret, because he finds that friend
holding philosophical tenets destructive,
as he thinks, of the sentiment of
moral obligation. “He is a fatalist
and indifferentist. I subscribe to
Kant’s principles with all my heart.
I have broken with M., not from any
dispute we have had, but on account
of the detestable conclusions which
necessarily follow from his opinions,
conclusions that absolutely annihilate
morality. I really loved him notwithstanding,
but, with such principles,
I could not be his friend.”
Considering the singular and precarious
tenure by which a Kantian holds
his faith in the freedom of the will,
this was rather severe dealing, not a
quite perfect example of philosophical
toleration; but it shows, at least, that
the heart was in the right place.</p>

<p class='c010'>Up to this moment have not the
fairies done well? But now comes a
new element into the calculations, a
new phase of the drama, with which
no fairies condescend to deal.
Young Niebuhr like the rest of us
<em>must live</em>, must earn the wherewithal,
must choose his career, his profession.
Here the fairies forsake him. Here,
in more true and prosaic style, he is
unfaithful to himself. We cannot
but regard it as the great and continuous
error of his life, that he did
not devote himself to learning as his
profession. He could have done so.
At the very same time there came an
offer of a professorship, and a proposal
to be the private secretary of
Count Schimmelman, the Danish
minister of finance. He chose the
latter. That the professorship offered
to him was connected with but
slender emolument, can have had
little to do with the determination,
because other and more eminent and
more lucrative professorships would
have speedily been open to him, and
because the mere love of money was
never a strong inducement in the
mind of Niebuhr. Political ambition
seems to have been the motive that
turned the scale. Looking now at
his life as an accomplished completed
career, it is impossible not to regret
this choice. We see ten of the most
precious years of his early manhood
wasted in financial and other public
business, which a hundred others
could have transacted as well; it is,
in fact, a mere fragment of his life
that is exclusively or uninterruptedly
devoted to letters. He is more
frequently at the head of some
national bank, or revenue department,
than in the professor’s chair; and the
author of the Roman history has to
say of himself, that “calculations are
my occupation; merchants, Jews, and
brokers, my society.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Niebuhr had, whilst at the university,
formed an acquaintance which
led afterwards to a matrimonial engagement.
Amelia Behrens, younger
sister of Madame Hensler, who was
the daughter-in-law of the Professor
Hensler previously mentioned, seems
from the first to have thoroughly
appreciated the high character and
great attainments of the young
student. She herself must have been
a woman of very superior mind; she
had great sweetness of temper, and
was in every way calculated for the
wife of the ardent, generous, hasty,
but affectionate Niebuhr. The first
mention that is made of Miss Behrens
is not very auspicious. In a letter to
his father, he has been lamenting his
painful timidity and bashfulness
before ladies, and thus continues,—“However
much I may improve in
other society, I am sure I must get
worse and worse every day in their
eyes; and so, out of downright shyness,
I scarcely dare speak to a lady;
and as I know, once for all, that I
must be insupportable to them, their
presence becomes disagreeable to me.
Yesterday, however, I screwed up
my courage, and began to talk to
Miss Behrens and young Mrs Hensler.
Now, in gratitude and candour, I
must confess that they were sociable
enough towards me to have set me
at my ease, if my shyness were not so
deeply rooted. But it is of no use.
I avoid them, and would rather be
guilty of impoliteness, by avoiding
them, than by speaking to them,
which I should now feel to be the
greatest impoliteness of all.” Circumstances,
however, after he had
left the university of Kiel, brought
him into social and unreserved communication
with the family of the
Behrens; and this lady whom he
avoided, dreading her precisely because
she <em>did</em> interest his youthful
imagination, became his betrothed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the biography takes a very
eccentric course. Niebuhr not only
comes to England on foreign travel,
which is precisely what we should
expect of such a person, but he settles
himself down at Edinburgh as a
student. <em>The life seems to go back.</em>
After having entered on official duties,
engaged himself to be married, and
thus pledged himself to the real business
of life, we see this erudite
youth, with his tale of twenty languages
nearly complete, entering the
classes at Edinburgh, and writing
about them as if he were recommencing
his university career. If this
work of Madame Hensler were one of
old date, and we felt authorised to
exercise upon it that conjectural
criticism so fashionable in our times,
we should boldly say that the authoress,
deceived by the similarity of
name, had intercalated into her series
some letters of <em>another Niebuhr</em>; we
should dispute the identity of the
Niebuhr who writes from the university
of Edinburgh, with him who
passed through the university of Kiel,
and was afterwards, for a short time,
secretary to Count Schimmelman.
Such conjectural emendations being,
however, altogether inadmissible, we
must accept the facts and the letters
as they are here given us.</p>

<p class='c010'>Niebuhr’s motives for this residence
in Scotland were, according to
Madame Hensler’s account, of a very
miscellaneous description. Besides
the advantages to be derived from
visiting a foreign land, “he was to
brace up and strengthen both his
mental and physical energies in preparation
for active life.” Why this
should be better accomplished as a
student in Edinburgh than as a citizen
in Copenhagen, we do not apprehend;
nor what there was in the air
of Denmark that had enfeebled the
spirit of self-reliance or of enterprise.
But we are told that “he had become
too dependent on the little details of
life. He felt that he stood, so to
speak, outside the world of realities.”
Therefore he sets himself down for a
year as a student at Edinburgh.</p>

<p class='c010'>London, of course, is first visited.
He speaks highly of the English.
Throughout his life he entertained a
predilection for our countrymen, and
extols the integrity and honesty of
the national character. We feel a
certain bashfulness, a modest confusion,
when we hear such praises; but,
as national characters nowhere stand
very high, we suppose we may accept
the compliment. Occasionally we sell
our patriotic votes, as at St Alban’s
and elsewhere; occasionally we fill
our canisters of preserved meats with
poisonous offal; and there is not a
grocer’s shop in all England where
some adulterated article of food is not
cheerfully disposed of. Nevertheless,
it seems we are a shade more honest
than some of our neighbours. The
compliment does not greatly rejoice us.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, it is not all praise that
we receive. He finds “that true
warm-heartedness is extremely rare”
amongst us. We shall be happy to
learn that it is commonly to be met
with in any part of the world. He
laments, too, the superficiality and
insipidity of general conversation.
“That narrative and commonplaces
form the whole staple of conversation,
from which all philosophy is excluded—that
enthusiasm and loftiness of
expression are entirely wanting, depresses
me more than any personal
neglect of which, as a stranger, I
might have to complain. I am, besides,
fully persuaded that I shall find
things very different in Scotland; of
this I am assured by several Scotchmen
whom I already know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In this full persuasion he sets forth
to Scotland. We have an account of
his journey, which, read in these railroad
times, is amusing enough. The
translator of the letters has evidently
been determined that we should not
miss the humour of the contrast.
Niebuhr gives his absent Amelia as
minute a description of the mode of
travelling as if he were writing from
China. After describing the post-chaises,
“very pretty half-coaches,
holding two,” and the royal mail,
rapid, “but inconvenient from the
smallness of its build, and particularly
liable to be upset,” he proceeds to
the old-fashioned stage-coach—</p>

<p class='c011'>“In travelling by this, you have no
further trouble than to take your place
in the office for as far as you wish to go;
for the proprietor of the coach has, at each
stage, which are from ten to fifteen English
miles at most from each other, relays
of horses, which, unless an unusual amount
of travelling causes an exception, stand
ready harnessed to be put to the coach.
Four horses, drawing a coach with six
persons inside, four on the roof, a sort of
conductor beside the coachman, and overladen
with luggage, have to get over
seven English miles in the hour; and, as
the coach goes on without ever stopping,
except at the principal stages, it is not
surprising that you can traverse the
whole extent of the country in so few
days. But, for any length of time, this
rapid motion is quite too unnatural. You
can only get a very piecemeal view of
the country from the windows, and, with
the tremendous speed with which you go,
can keep no object long in sight; you are
unable also to stop at any place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After three days’ travelling “at
this tremendous speed,” he reached
Newcastle, from which the above
letter was dated. The rest of the
journey was also performed with the
same unnatural rapidity. By some
chance he made acquaintance with a
young medical student, and the two
together commenced housekeeping in
Edinburgh on a very frugal and
sensible plan.</p>

<p class='c010'>The letters which Niebuhr wrote to
his parents from Edinburgh, and
which contained his observations on
the graver matters of politics and of
learning, were unfortunately burnt;
those which were addressed to his
betrothed have been alone preserved,
and these chiefly concern matters of
a domestic and personal nature. We
hear, therefore, very little of the more
learned society into which, doubtless,
Niebuhr occasionally entered.
With Professor Playfair he formed an
intimacy which was afterwards renewed
at Rome. Other names are
mentioned, but no particulars are
given. The subjects which he principally
studied in Edinburgh were
mathematics and physical sciences.
Philological and historical studies he
prosecuted by himself, and by way
of recreation. “In these departments
he regarded the learned men there as
incomparably inferior to the Germans.”
A Mr Scott, an old friend of
his father’s, and to whom he brought
letters of introduction, was the most
intimate acquaintance he possessed.
The quite patriarchal reception that he
received from Mr Scott and his family
will be read with interest. As to
his impressions of the Scotch, as a
people, these are extremely various:
he is at one time charmed with their
unexampled piety; at another, he
finds it a dreary formalism; and then,
again, from the height of his Kantian
philosophy, he detects a shallow
French infidelity pervading the land.
Such inconsistencies are natural and
excusable in a young man writing
down his first impressions in a most
unreserved correspondence. But there
would be very little gained by quoting
them here at length. We pass on
from this episode in the life, and now
proceed with the main current of
events.</p>

<p class='c010'>On his return to Copenhagen,
Niebuhr was appointed assessor at
the board of trade for the East India
department, with some other secretaryship
or clerkship of a similar
description. Thereupon he married,
(May 1800;) and in some letters
written soon after this event, he
describes himself as in a quite celestial
state of happiness. “Amelia’s
heavenly disposition, and more than
earthly love, raise me above this
world, and as it were separate me
from this life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then come official promotion and
increased occupation. Nevertheless
his favourite studies are never altogether
laid aside. The day might
be spent at his office or in the exchange,
in drawing up reports, in
correspondence or in interviews with
most uninteresting people, and when
the night came he was often exhausted
both in body and in mind;
yet, “if he got engaged at once in an
interesting book or conversation, he
was soon refreshed, and would then
study till late at night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Towards the end of 1805 a distinguished
Prussian statesman, whose
name is not here given, and who was
then at Copenhagen on a mission
from his government, sounded Niebuhr
on his willingness to enter the
Prussian service in the department of
finance. After much hesitation and
some correspondence, Niebuhr finally
accepted a proposal made to him of
“the joint-directorship of the first
bank in Berlin, and of the <em>Seehandlung</em>,”
a privileged commercial company
(as a note of the editor informs
us) for the promotion of foreign commerce.
Such were the labours to
which Niebuhr was willing to devote
the extraordinary powers of his mind—such
were the services which his
contemporaries were willing to accept
from him. But we have only to
glance at the date of these transactions
to call to mind that we are traversing
no peaceful or settled times.
We are, in fact, in the thick of the war.
Whilst Niebuhr was working at his
assessorship in Copenhagen, that city
was bombarded by the English; and
now that he goes to take possession
of his directorship in Berlin, he has
to fly with royalty itself before the
armies of Napoleon. The battle of
Jena, and many other battles, have
been fought and lost, and the French
are advancing on the capital. Flight
to Memel, ministerial changes, alternate
rise and fall of Von Stein and
Count Hardenberg—in all these
events poor Niebuhr was now implicated.
When peace is made with
Napoleon, we find him despatched to
Holland to negotiate a Dutch loan,
the Prussian government being in
great distress for money to pay the
contributions imposed upon them by
the French. Then follows some misunderstanding
with Count Hardenberg,
who has succeeded to power,
which happily interrupts for a time
the official career of our great scholar.
He is appointed Professor of History
in the university of Berlin. In
Michaelmas 1810 the university reopened,
and Niebuhr delivered his
first course of lectures on the history
of Rome.</p>

<p class='c010'>For about three years we now
see him in what every one will recognise
as his right and legitimate place
in the world, and labouring at his
true vocation. His lectures excited
the keenest interest—he was encouraged
to undertake his great work,
<cite>The History of Rome</cite>: it is in this
interval that both the first and second
volumes were published. An extract
from his letters will show the pleasant
change in his career, and give
us some insight into the position he
held in the university.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Milly (his wife Amelia) has told you
that the number of my hearers was much
greater than I had anticipated. But
their character, no less than their number,
is such as encourages and animates
me to pursue my labours with zeal and
perseverance. You will feel this when I
tell you that Savigny, Schleiermacher,
Spalding, Ancillon, Nicolovius, Schmedding,
and Süvern were present. Besides
the number and selectness of my audience,
the general interest evinced in the lecture
exceeds my utmost hopes. My introductory
lecture produced as strong
an impression as an oration could have
done; and all the dry erudition that followed
it, in the history of the old Italian
tribes, which serves as an introduction to
that of Rome, has not driven away even
my unlearned hearers. The attention
with which Savigny honours me, and his
declaration that I am opening a new era
for Roman history, naturally stimulates
my ardent desire to carry out to the full
extent the researches which one is apt to
leave half finished as soon as one clearly
perceives the result to which they tend,
in order to turn to something fresh....</p>

<p class='c012'>“With a little more quiet, my position
would be one more completely in accordance
with my wishes than I have long
ventured even to hope for. There is
such a real mutual attachment between
my acquaintances and myself, and our
respective studies give such an inexhaustible
interest to conversation, that
I now really possess in this respect what
I used to feel the want of; for intercourse
of this kind is quickening and instructive.
The lectures themselves, too,
are inspiriting, because they require persevering
researches, which, I venture to
say, cannot remain unfruitful to me; and
they are more exciting than mere literary
labours, because I deliver them with the
warmth inspired by fresh thoughts and
discoveries, and afterwards converse with
those who have heard them, and to whom
they are as new as to myself. This
makes the lectures a positive delight to
me, and I feel quite averse to bring them
to a close. What I should like, would
be to have whole days of perfect solitude,
and then an interval of intercourse with
the persons I really like, but not to remain
so many hours together with them
as is customary here. It would be
scarcely possible to have less frivolity
and dulness in a mixed society. Schleiermacher
is the most intellectual man
amongst them. The complete absence of
jealousy among these scholars is particularly
gratifying.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not long we are allowed to
pause upon this agreeable and fruitful
era of intellectual activity. Two
volumes, however, are published of
that history of which it is not here
our purpose to speak, of which we
would not wish to speak lightly or
inconsiderately, which we admire and
would cordially applaud, but which,
we feel, has not yet received its exact
place or value in the historical literature
of Europe. We have not the
time, nor will we lay claim to the
profound erudition requisite, to do full
justice to Niebuhr’s <cite>History of Rome</cite>.
We do not regret, therefore, that the
present occasion calls for no decided
verdict; and that it does not devolve
on us to draw the line, and show
where just, and bold, and discriminating
criticism terminates, and where
ingenious and happy conjecture begins
to assume the air and confidence
of history. On one point there can
be no dispute—that his work exercised
a great, and, upon the whole,
a most salutary influence on historical
criticism. It is not too much to
say, that no history has been written
since its appearance in which this influence
cannot be traced.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both volumes were received in a
most cordial and encouraging manner
by his friends and by the public, and
materials for a third volume were
being collected, when suddenly we
hear that our professor—is drilling for
the army! Napoleon’s disastrous
campaign in Russia has given hope
to every patriotic German to throw
off the degrading yoke of France.
Niebuhr, though by his father’s side
of Danish extraction, was, in heart,
wholly a German. When the Landwehr
was called out he refused to
avail himself of the privilege of his
position to evade serving in it—he
sent in his name as a volunteer, and
prepared himself by the requisite
exercises. Meanwhile, till he could
do battle with the musket, he fought
with the pen, and edited a newspaper.
“Niebuhr’s friends in Holstein,”
writes Madame Hensler,
“could hardly trust their eyes when
he wrote them word that he was
drilling for the army, and that his
wife entered with equal enthusiasm
into his feelings. The greatness of
the object had so inspired Madame
Niebuhr, who was usually anxious,
even to a morbid extent, at the slightest
imaginable peril for the husband
in whom she might truly be said to
live, that she was willing and ready
to bring even her most precious treasure
as a sacrifice to her country.”</p>

<p class='c010'>French troops were now constantly
passing through Berlin, on their way
from the fatal plains of Russia. The
dreadful sufferings which they had
manifestly endured did not fail to
excite a general compassion; but their
appearance excited still more the patriotic
hopes of the citizens to liberate
themselves from the degrading domination
of France. Berlin was evacuated
by the French. Then came
the Cossacks, following in the route
of the common enemy. “They
bivouac,” says a letter of Niebuhr,
“with their horses in the city; about
four in the morning they knock at the
doors, and ask for breakfast. This is
a famous time for the children, for
they set them on their horses, and
play with them.” Here is an extract
that will bring the times vividly before
us. Niebuhr is writing to Madame
Hensler:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I come from an employment in which
you will hardly be able to fancy me engaged—namely,
exercising. Even before
the departure of the French, I began to
go through the exercise in private, but a
man can scarcely acquire it without a
companion. Since the French left, a party
of about twenty of us have been exercising
in a garden, and we have already got
over the most difficult part of the training.
When my lectures are concluded,
which they will be at the beginning of
next week, I shall try to exercise with
regular recruits during the morning, and,
as often as possible, practise shooting at
a mark.... By the end of a
month, I hope to be as well drilled as
any recruit who is considered to have
finished his training. The heavy musket
gave me so much trouble at first, that I
almost despaired of being able to handle
it; but we are able to recover the powers
again that we have only lost for want of
practice. I am happy to say that my
hands are growing horny; for as long as
they had a delicate bookworm’s skin, the
musket cut into them terribly....</p>

<p class='c012'>“I mentioned to you a short time since,
my hopes of getting a secretaryship on
the general staff. With my small measure
of physical power, I should have
been a thousand times more useful in
that office than as a private soldier. The
friend I have referred to would like me
to enter the ministry. Perhaps something
unexpected may yet turn up. Idle,
or busy about anything but our liberation,
I cannot be now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is impossible to read the account
of these stirring times <em>just now</em>, without
asking ourselves whether it is
probable that our own learned professors
of Oxford and Cambridge may
ever have their patriotism put to a
similar trial. Perhaps, even under
similar circumstances, they would act
the wiser part by limiting themselves
to patriotic exhortations to the youth
under their control or influence. Of
one thing we feel persuaded, that
there would be no lack of ardour, or
of martial enthusiasm, amongst the
students of our venerable universities.
After a few months drilling and practising,
there would be raised such a
corps of riflemen from Oxford and
Cambridge as fields of battle have
not often seen. How intelligence <em>tells</em>,
when you put a musket in its hands,
is as yet but faintly understood. We,
for our own part, hope that the
<em>voluntary principle</em> will here arouse
itself in time, and do its bidding
nobly. For as to that ordinary militia,
which is neither voluntary service
nor thorough discipline, where there
is neither intelligence, nor ardour, nor
professional spirit, nor any one good
quality of a soldier, we have no confidence
in it whatever: we would not
willingly trust our hen-coops to such
a defence; there is neither body nor
soul in it. As a reserve force from
which to recruit for the regular army,
it may be useful. But to drill and
train a set of unwilling servitors like
these, with the intention of taking
the field with them, would be a fatal
mistake; for it would lull the nation
into a false sense of security. But a
regiment of volunteers of the spirited
and intelligent youth of England, we
would match with entire confidence
against an equal number of any troops
in the world. Why should not there
be permanent rifle-clubs established
in every university, and in every town?
These, and our standing army, increased
to its necessary complement,
would constitute a safe defence. Volunteers,
it is said, cannot be kept
together except in moments of excitement.
And this was true while the
volunteers had only to drill and to
march; but practice with the rifle is
itself as great an amusement as
archery, or boating, or cricket, or any
other that engages the active spirit
of our youth. There is a skill to be
acquired which would prompt emulation.
There is an art to learn. These
clubs would meet together, both for
competition, and for the purpose of
practising military evolutions on a
larger scale, and thus the spirit of the
institution would be maintained, and
its utility increased. Nor would it be
difficult to suggest some honorary
privilege which might be attached to
the volunteer rifleman. Such, we are
persuaded, is the kind of militia which
England ought to have for her defence;
such, we are persuaded, is the
only force, beside the standing army,
on which any reliance can safely be
placed.</p>

<p class='c010'>All honour to the historian who
unravels for us the obscurities of the
past! Nevertheless, one simple truth
will stare us in the face. We take
infinite pains to understand the Roman
<em>comitia</em>; we read, not without
considerable labour, some pages of
Thucydides; yet the daily English
newspaper has been bringing to our
door accounts of a political experiment
now enacting before us, more
curious and more instructive than
Roman and Grecian history can supply.
The experiment, which has been
fairly performed on a neighbouring
shore, gives a more profound lesson,
and a far more important one, than
twenty Peloponnesian wars. That
experiment has demonstrated to us
that, <em>by going low enough</em>, you may
obtain a public opinion that shall
sanction a tyranny over the whole
intelligence of the country. A man
who, whatever his abilities, had acquired
no celebrity in civil or military
life, inherits a name; with that
name he appeals to the universal
suffrage of France; and universal
France gives him permission to do
what he will with her laws and institutions—to
destroy her parliament—to
silence her press—to banish philosophy
from her colleges. It is a lesson
of the utmost importance; and moreover,
a fact which, at the present
moment, justifies some alarm. It is
not intelligent France we have for our
neighbour, but a power which represents
its military and its populace,
and which surely, if we are to calculate
on its duration, is of a very terrific
character. But we must pursue
our biographical sketch of the life of
Niebuhr.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although our professor never actually
shoulders that musket of which
we have seen him practising the use,
and gets no nearer to the smoke of
powder than to survey the battle of
Bautzen from the heights, he is involved
in all the civil turmoils of the
time. He is summoned to Dresden,
where the King of Prussia and the
Emperor of Russia are in conference
together. He follows the Sovereigns to
Prague; he is again despatched to Holland,
to negotiate there for subsidies
with the English commissioners. Saddest
event of all, his domestic happiness
receives a fatal blow in the
death of his wife. She must have
been a woman of tender spirit and
elevated character. She entered ardently
into all the pursuits, and
shared all the fame, of her husband.
A few days before her death, Niebuhr,
as he was holding her in his
arms, asked her if there was no pleasure
that he could give her—nothing
that he could do for her sake. She
replied, with a look of unutterable
love, “You shall finish your history,
whether I live or die.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The history, however, proceeded
very slowly. When public tranquillity
was restored, Niebuhr did not
return to his professor’s chair; he
went, as is very generally known, to
Rome on a diplomatic mission. Here
he spent a considerable portion of his
life; and although his residence in
that city might seem peculiarly favourable
to his great undertaking, yet it
proved otherwise;—either his time was
occupied in the business or the ceremonial
attached to his appointment,
or his mind was unhinged. Besides,
we have seen, from his own confession,
that he needed such stimulants as
those he found at Berlin, of friends,
and conversation, and a literary duty,
to keep him to one train of inquiry
or of labour. It was very much the
habit of his mind to propose to himself
numerous works or literary investigations.
We have amongst his loose
memoranda of an earlier date one
headed thus, “Works which I have
to complete.” The list comprises no
less than seven works, every one of
which would have been a laborious
undertaking. No scheme or outline
of these several projected books was
to be found, but the writer of the
Memoir before us remarks that we are
not to infer from this that such memoranda
contain mere projects, towards
whose execution no step was
ever taken.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That Niebuhr proposed,” says Madame
Hensler, “any such work to himself, was
a certain sign that he had read and
thought deeply on the subject; but he
was able to trust so implicitly to his extraordinary
memory, that he never committed
any portion of his essays to paper
till the whole was complete in his own
mind. His memory was so wonderfully
retentive that he scarcely ever forgot
anything which he had once heard or
read, and the facts he knew remained
present to him at all times, even in their
minutest details.</p>

<p class='c012'>“His wife and sister once playfully
took up Gibbon, and asked him questions
from the table of contents about the most
trivial things, by way of testing his memory.
They carried on the examination
till they were tired, and gave up all hope
of even detecting him in a momentary
uncertainty, though he was at the same
time engaged in writing on some other
subject.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Niebuhr married a second time.
Madame Hensler, accompanied by her
niece, had visited him in his affliction;
their presence gradually cheered him;
and Margaret Hensler, the niece,
“soothed him with her gentle attentions,
and gave him peculiar pleasure
with her sweet singing. After some
time he engaged himself to her, and
married her before he left Berlin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We have now to follow him to
Rome. The correspondence is here,
as indeed throughout these volumes,
very entertaining; and it would be
utterly impossible to convey to our
readers, in our brief survey, a fair
impression of the sort of interest this
work possesses. The memoir may be
regarded as merely explanatory of the
letters, and the letters themselves are
not distinguished so much by remarkable
passages as by a constantly sustained
interest. They are not learned,
for the erudite portion of the correspondence
has been omitted, but they
are never trivial; they perpetually
suggest some topic of reflection, and
are thoroughly imbued with the character
and personality of the writer.
We have lately had several biographies
of eminent men written on the
same plan, the letters being set forth
as the most faithful portraiture of the
man; but in none of these, so far as we
can recall them to mind, are the letters
at once so valuable in themselves,
and so curious for the insight they
give us into the character and feelings
of the writer.</p>

<p class='c010'>In reading Niebuhr’s letters from
Italy, we must always bear in mind
that they are written by one of warm
and somewhat irascible temper, and
who has a standard of moral excellence
which would be thought of a
most inconvenient altitude by the
people of any country in Europe. He
is honest as the day, but open to receive
very sudden and much too
strong impressions. We must also
look at the date of his letters, and
ask ourselves what changes may have
taken place since Niebuhr wrote.
With these precautions, they will be
found to convey many very instructive
hints. From his first entrance
into Italy to the last hour of his residence,
he expresses the same opinion
of the low standard of intellectual
culture amongst its educated classes.
Whilst he is yet at Florence, he writes
thus:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“My preconceived opinion of the
scholars and higher classes in Italy has
proved perfectly correct, as I was convinced
would be the case, because I possessed
sufficient data to form an accurate
idea of them. I have always allowed
the existence of individual exceptions, as
regards erudition; but even in these cases,
there is not that cultivation of the whole
man which we demand and deem indispensable.
I have become acquainted with
two or three literary men of real ability;
but, in the first place, they are old men,
who have only a few years longer to live;
and when they are gone, Italy will be, as
they say themselves, in a state of barbarism;
and, in the second, they are like
statues wrought to be placed in a frieze
on the wall—the side turned towards you
is of finished beauty, the other unhewn
stone. They are much what our scholars
may have been sixty or eighty years ago.
No one feels himself a citizen....</p>

<p class='c012'>“The three genuine and intellectual
scholars of my acquaintance, Morelli,
Garatoni, and Fontana, are all ecclesiastics.
They are, however, only ecclesiastics
by profession, for I have not found in
them the slightest trace either of a belief
in the dogmas of Catholicism, or of the
pietism which you meet with in Germany.
<em>When an Italian has once ceased to be a
slave of the Church, he never seems to
trouble his head about such matters at all.
Metaphysical speculations are utterly
foreign to his nature, as they were to the
old Romans.</em> Hence the vacuity of mind
which has become general since the suppression
of freedom, except in the case
of those who find a sphere of action in
writing literary and historical memoirs.
Their public men are immeasurably behind
the Germans in knowledge and cultivation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>What matter for reflection there
is here, the reader will not need our
assistance to point out. Let those
who censure Protestantism for the
spirit of speculation it is connected
with, either as cause or effect, consider
how important a part that speculative
tendency plays in sustaining
the intellectual activity of a people.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Niebuhr arrives at Rome,
the picture that he draws is still
darker. Even the antiquities of the
city seem to have given him little
pleasure; he was more disturbed at
what had been taken away than gratified
by the little that remained.
Then, although he well knew that
the life of an ambassador at Rome
could not be free from restraint and
interruption, yet the courtly formalities
he was compelled to observe were
far more vexatious than he had anticipated.
Housekeeping, too, perplexed
him. Things were dear, and
men not too honest. “Without a
written agreement nothing can be
done.” In a letter to Savigny, he
writes thus:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rome has no right to its name; at
most, it should be called New Rome.
Not one single street here goes in the
same direction as the old one; it is an
entirely foreign vegetation that has
grown up on a part of the old soil, as
insignificant and thoroughly modern in
its style as possible, without nationality,
without history. It is very characteristic
that the really ancient and the modern
city lie almost side by side.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are nowhere any remains of
anything that it was possible to remove.
The ruins all date from the time of the
emperors; and he who can get up an
enthusiasm about them, must at least
rank Martial and Sophocles together....
St Peter’s, the Sistine Chapel, and
the Loggie, are certainly splendid; but
even St Peter’s is disfigured internally
by the wretched statues and decorations....
Science is utterly extinct here.
Of philologists, there is none worthy of
the name except the aged De Rossi,
who is near his end. The people are
apathetic.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This, then, is the country and place
in which my life is to be passed! It is
but a poor amends that I can get from
libraries, and yet my only hope is from
the Vatican. That we may be crossed
in every way, this is closed till the 5th
of November, and to have it opened
sooner is out of the question; in other
respects, all possible facilities have been
promised me by the Pope himself, Cardinal
Gonsalvi, Monsignor Testi, and the
Prefect of the library, Monsignor Baldi.
This last is now engaged in printing, at
his own cost, a work on which he has expended
six hundred scudi, without hope
of receiving any compensation for it. It
is on seventeen passages in the Old Testament,
in which he has found the cross
mentioned by name.... At Terni,
I found the old art of land-surveying still
extant: I rode along what was probably
an ancient ‘limes,’ found the ‘rigor,’ and
the ‘V. Pedes.’ I shall go there again,
if I live till next autumn. It is a charming
place. There are at least fifty houses
in the town, among them one very large,
which date from the Roman times, and
which have never yet been observed or
described by any traveller. Several of
the churches are Roman private houses.
If one could but discover in Rome anything
like this! I long inexpressibly to
have it for my burial-place. Everything
is ancient in Terni and its neighbourhood—even
the mode of preparing the
wine. Oh to have been in Italy five
hundred years ago!”</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the most agreeable topics
mentioned in the period of his biography,
is the interest Niebuhr took
in the new school of German art then
springing up at Rome. Every one,
from prints and engravings, if from
no other source, is now acquainted
with the works of Cornelius, Overbeck,
Veit, Schadow, and others.
They were then struggling with all the
usual difficulties of unemployed and
unrecognised genius. Niebuhr neither
possessed, nor affected to possess,
any special knowledge of art, but he
was delighted with the genuine enthusiasm
of his fellow-countrymen; he
kindled in their society; he was persuaded
of their great talent, and
exerted whatever influence he possessed
in obtaining for them some
high employment. He wished that
the interior of some church or other
public building should be placed at
their disposal, to decorate it with suitable
paintings. The scattered notices
that we find here of these artists we
pass over very unwillingly, but we
must necessarily confine ourselves to
the course of our narrative.</p>

<p class='c010'>By his first wife, Niebuhr had no
family. His second, <em>Gretchen</em> as she
is affectionately called—and who, we
may observe in passing, is described
as equally amiable, though not quite
so intellectual or cultivated as the
first—brought him several children,
one son and three daughters. The
birth of his son, April 1817, was an
event which gave him the keenest
delight, and kindled in all their fervour
his naturally ardent affections.
It was the first thing, we are told,
that really dispelled the melancholy
that fell on him after the loss of his
<em>Milly</em>. It is curious and touching to
note how he mingled up his reminiscences
of his first wife with this
gift brought him by the second.
Writing to Madame Hensler, he
says:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The trial is over, but it has been a
terrible trial. How Gretchen rejoices in
the possession of her darling child after
all her suffering, you can well imagine.
Her patience was indescribable. In my
terrible anxiety I prayed most earnestly,
<em>and entreated my Milly, too, for help. I
comforted Gretchen with telling her that
Milly would send help.</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then come plans for the education
of the boy. How much does the following
brief extract suggest!—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am thinking a great deal about his
education. I told you a little while ago
how I intended to teach him the ancient
languages very early, by practice. I
wish the child to believe all that is told
him; and I now think you write in an
assertion which I have formerly disputed,
that it is better to tell children no tales,
but to keep to the poets. But while I
shall repeat and read the old poets to
him in such a way that he will undoubtedly
take the gods and heroes for historical
beings, I shall tell him, at the same
time, that the ancients had only an imperfect
knowledge of the true God, and
that these gods were overthrown when
Christ came into the world. He shall
believe in the letter of the Old and New
Testaments, and I shall nurture in him
from his infancy a firm faith in all that I
have lost, or feel uncertain about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On the opposite page we read the
following letter to the same correspondent,
Madame Hensler:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have spent yesterday and last night
in thinking of my Milly, and this day,
too, is sacred to these recollections. I
saw her a few days ago in a dream. She
seemed as if returning to me after a long
separation. I felt uncertain, as one so
often does in dreams, whether she was
still living on this earth, or only appeared
on it for a transient visit. She greeted
me as if after a long absence, <em>asked hastily
after the child, and took it in her arms</em>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Happy are those who can cherish
such a hallowing remembrance as that of
the departure of my Milly with pious
faith, trusting for a brighter and eternal
spring. Such a faith cannot be acquired
by one’s own efforts. Oh that it may
one day be my portion!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My son shall have a firm faith in
all that I have lost, or feel uncertain
about!” May the paternal hope, and
the paternal confidence in its own
“plans of education,” be fully justified.</p>

<p class='c010'>One thing appears evident, that a
residence at Rome (at least at the
period when Niebuhr wrote) could
not be very propitious to the cultivation
of faith in educated minds.
What is brought before us very
vividly in these letters, and without
any purposed design, is the combination
of cold, worldly formalism, not to
say hypocrisy, with harsh intolerant
measures. The priesthood, with
whom Niebuhr mingles, detest fanaticism,
yet act with systematic
bigotry. What union can be more
repulsive than this—the cold heart
and the heavy hand! A pious
Chaldean, a man of great ability,
comes to Rome to get a Bible printed
there in his native language, under
the censorship of the Propaganda.
He applies to Niebuhr to assist him
with money; Niebuhr exerts himself
in his cause. The Chaldean is
banished from Rome. His offence is
not, as might perhaps be apprehended,
the wish to print the Bible; he has
accepted assistance from our Bible
Society in carrying out his scheme.
In sharp contrast with bigoted conduct
of this description, we have
Niebuhr’s general impression of the
utter coldness of heart amongst the
ecclesiastics at Rome. They run as
follows—(the R. in this extract
stands for Ringseis, a physician who
had accompanied the Crown Prince
of Bavaria to Rome, and who was a
zealous and pious Catholic):—</p>

<p class='c011'>“About the Italians you will have
heard R’s. testimony, and we Protestants
can leave it to him to paint the clergy,
and the state of religion in this country.
In fact, we are all cold and dead compared
to his indignation. His society
has been a great pleasure to us all, even
to our reserved friend Bekker, who in
general turns pale at the very thought of
Popery, and finds me far too indulgent.
With an enthusiast so full of heart as R.
you can get on; between such a luxuriance
of fancy and the unshackled reason,
there is much such an analogy as
subsists between science and art; whilst,
on the contrary, the slavish subjection to
the Church is ghastly death. The most
superficial prophet of so-called enlightenment
cannot have a more sincere aversion
to enthusiasm than the Roman priesthood;
and, in fact, their superstition
bears no trace of it. Little as the
admirers of Italy care for my words, I
know that I am perfectly correct in saying,
that even among the laity you cannot
discover a vestige of piety.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the years pass on, and
the education of the little boy really
begins. Niebuhr says he succeeds in
the task better than he could venture
to hope. Our readers cannot but be
curious to know what was the course
of instruction the great historian
pursued.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Marcus already knows no inconsiderable
number of Latin words, and he understands
grammar so well that I can now
set him to learn parts of the conjunctions
without their teasing him like dead matter:
he derives many of the forms from
his own feeling. I am reading with him
selected chapters from Hygin’s <cite><span lang="la">Mythologicum</span></cite>—a
book which perhaps it is not
easy to use for this purpose, and which
yet is more suited to it than any other,
from the absence of formal periods, and
the interest of the narrative. For German,
I write fragments of the Greek
mythology for him. I began with the
history of the Argonauts; I have now
got to the history of Hercules. I give
everything in a very free and picturesque
style, so that it is as exciting as poetry
to him: and, in fact, he reads it with
such delight that we are often interrupted
by his cries of joy. The child is
quite devoted to me; but this educating
costs me a great deal of time. However,
I have had my share of life, and I shall
consider it as a reward for my labours if
this young life be as fully and richly
developed as lies within my power.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Unexpected thoughts often escape
him. Two days ago he was sitting beside
me and began, ‘Father, the ancients
believed in the old gods; but they must
have believed also in the true God. The
old gods were just like men.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>All this time we have said nothing
of the political embassy of Niebuhr.
He was appointed ambassador to
Rome to negotiate a concordat with
the Pope. But it appears that several
years elapsed before he received
his instructions from his own court.
We hardly know, therefore, whether
to say that the negotiations were
prolonged, or that their commencement
had been delayed. Niebuhr
always speaks in high terms of the
Pope, (Pius VII.,) as a man every
way estimable. Between them a
very friendly feeling seems to have
subsisted. There does not appear,
therefore, to have been any peculiar
or vexatious delay on the part of the
Holy See. After Niebuhr had been
in Rome more than four years, Count
Hardenberg, the Prussian minister,
who had been attending the conference
at Laybach, made his appearance
on the scene. To him, as we
gather from the very brief account
before us, was attributed with some
unfairness the merit of concluding the
negotiations. However this might
be, the terms of this concordat were
at length agreed upon, and Niebuhr
had no longer any peculiar mission to
detain him at Rome. Shortly afterwards
he petitioned for leave of
absence, and returned to Germany.
He never went back again to Rome,
but happily resumed the professor’s
chair—this time, however, in the
University of Bonn; or rather he
delivered lectures at Bonn, for it does
not appear that he was an appointed
professor.</p>

<p class='c010'>But before we leave Rome for
Bonn, or diplomacy for the professorial
duties, we must glance at a
little essay given us in the appendix,
written by Chevalier Bunsen, and
entitled <cite>Niebuhr as a Diplomatist in
Rome</cite>. Bunsen was, during part of
this period, secretary to the embassy,
and of course in perpetual communication
with Niebuhr. The few anecdotes
he relates present us with a
very distinct picture of this German
Cato amongst the modern Romans.
Judging by what are popularly understood
to be the qualifications of a
diplomatist, we should certainly say
that our historian was by no means
peculiarly fitted for this department
of the public service. He was an
unbending man, had much of the
stoic in his principles, though very
little of the stoic in his affections, and
was more disposed to check or crush
the hollow frivolity about him than
to yield to it, or to play with it. He
could throw a whole dinner-table into
consternation, by solemnly denouncing
the tone of levity which the conversation
had assumed. At the house of
some prince in Rome the events then
transpiring in Greece had led Niebuhr
to speak with earnestness on the
future destiny of the Christian Hellenes.
On the first pause that
occurred, a fashionable diner-out contrived
to turn the conversation, and
in a few moments the whole table
was alive with a discussion—on this
important point, whether a certain
compound sold at the Roman coffee-houses,
under the slang name of
“aurora,” was mostly coffee or mostly
chocolate! Niebuhr sat silent for
some time; but he, too, took advantage
of the next pause to express his
indignation and surprise, that “in
such times, and with such events
occurring around us, we should be
entertained with such miserable
trifles!” For a short time all were
mute. Not a very diplomatic style,
we should say, of conversation.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was very characteristic of such a
man, that, on the occasion of giving a
grand entertainment in his character
of ambassador, he should have the
music of the Sistine Chapel performed
in his house. He detested the modern
Italian operatic music. He
thought it becoming his embassadorial
position that something national
should be selected. He therefore
chose that celebrated music which
all foreigners make it a point of duty
to go and listen to at the Sistine
Chapel during Passion Week. When
the gay assemblage, after an animated
conversation, repaired for the concert
to the brilliantly lighted saloon, a
choir of sixteen singers from the
chapel filled the air with their solemn
strains. We do not wonder, as
Chevalier Bunsen says, that “the
assembly was evidently seized with a
peculiar feeling,” or that many of
them stole away to something they
thought more amusing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even his connection with the
learned men of Rome was not of long
continuance. But this was owing to
no want of sympathy in their studies
or pursuits on the part of Niebuhr, as
the following anecdote will testify—(those
who know Leopardi as a poet
will read it with peculiar interest):—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I still remember the day when he
(Niebuhr) entered with unwonted vivacity
the office in which I was writing,
and exclaimed, ‘I must drive out directly
to seek out the greatest philological
genius of Italy that I have as yet heard
of, and make his acquaintance. Just
look at the man’s critical remarks upon
the Chronicle of Eusebius. What acuteness!
What real erudition! I have
never seen anything like it before in this
country—I must see the man.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“In two hours he came back. ‘I
found him at last with a great deal of
trouble, in a garret of the Palazzo Mattei.
Instead of a man of mature age, I found
a youth of two or three and twenty,
deformed, weakly, and who has never had
a good teacher, but has fed his intellect
upon the books of his grandfather, in his
father’s house at Recanati; has read
the classics and the Fathers; is, at the
same time, as I hear, one of the first
poets and writers of his nation, and is
withal poor, neglected, and evidently
depressed. One sees in him what genius
this richly endowed nation possesses.’
Capei has given a pleasing and true
description of the astonishment experienced
by both the great men at their
first meeting; of the tender affection with
which Niebuhr regarded Leopardi, and
all that he did for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Our diminishing space warns us
that we must limit ourselves to the
last scene of the life and labours of
Niebuhr. After some intervals spent
at Berlin, he took up his residence at
Bonn, recommenced his lectures, recommenced
his History. Before proceeding
further in his task, he found
it necessary to revise the two volumes
already published. In this revision
he engaged so zealously that he
almost re-wrote them. The third
volume, as is well known, was not
published in his lifetime: the manuscript
was revised for the press by his
friend and disciple, Professor Classen.</p>

<p class='c010'>This and other manuscripts ran the
risk of being consumed by the flames;
for his new house, in the planning
and arrangement of which he had
taken much pleasure, was burnt down
on the night of the 6th February
1830. It was indeed a misfortune,
he said, but he did not feel as he felt
“that night when he was near headquarters
at the battle of Bautzen,
and believed the cause of his country
to be, if not lost, in the most imminent
peril.” But though much else
was destroyed, the books and papers
were preserved; and there was great
rejoicing when here and there a precious
treasure was found again, which
had been looked on as lost; and the
reappearance of the longed-for manuscript
of the second volume of the
history (then going through the press)
was greeted with hearty cheers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The prospect of public affairs, now
embroiled by the French Revolution
of 1830, seems to have disturbed him
more than the loss of his house.
From the selfishness of the governing
party, and the rashness of their opponents,
he was disposed to predict the
saddest results—loss of freedom, civil
and religious. “In fifty years,” he
says in one place, “and probably
much less, there will be no trace left of
free institutions, or the freedom of the
press, throughout all Europe—at least
on the Continent.” In this enforced
darkness, Protestantism would, of
course, have no chance against her
great antagonist. Wherever the spirit
of mental freedom decays, the Roman
Catholic must triumph. He says,
“Already, all the old evils have
awakened to full activity; all the
priestcraft, all, even the most gigantic
plans for conquest and subjugation;
and there is no doubt that they are
secretly aiming at, and working towards,
a religious war, and all that
tends to bring it on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The interest which Niebuhr took
in the public events of Europe was
indirectly the cause of his last illness.
One evening he spent a considerable
time waiting and reading in the hot
news-room, without taking off his
thick fur cloak, and then returned
home through the cold frosty night
air, heated in mind and body. He
looked in, as he passed, on his friend
Classen, to unburden some portion of
his fervid cares for the universal commonwealth.
“But,” said he, “I
have taken a severe chill, I must go
to bed.” And from the couch he
then sought he never rose again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the afternoon of the 1st of January
1830,” thus concludes the account of
his last days which we have from the
pen of Professor Classen, “he sank into
a dreamy slumber: once, on awakening,
he said that pleasant images floated before
him in sleep; now and then he spoke
French in his dreams; probably he felt
himself in the presence of his departed
friend De Serre. As the night gathered,
consciousness gradually faded away; he
woke up once more about midnight, when
the last remedy was administered; he
recognised in it a medicine of doubtful
operation, never resorted to but in
extreme cases, and said in a faint voice,
‘What essential substance is this? Am I
so far gone?’ These were his last words;
he sank back on his pillow, and within an
hour his noble heart had ceased to beat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Any attempt at the final estimate
of Niebuhr as a historian, we have
already said we shall not make. The
permanence of the structure that he
has reared must be tested by time
and the labours of many scholars.
Indeed, where a reputation like this
is concerned, old father Time will be
slow in his operations—he is a long
while trimming the balance and
shuffling the weights—perhaps new
weights are to be made. Niebuhr’s
great and salutary influence in historical
literature, we repeat, is undeniable;
and this signal merit will always be
accorded to him. For his character
as a man, this is better portrayed
even by the few extracts we have
been able to make from his letters,
than by any summary or description
we could give. But these extracts
have necessarily been brief, and are
unavoidably taken, here and there,
from letters which it would have been
much more desirable to quote <em>in extenso</em>,
and therefore we recommend
every reader who can bestow the
leisure, to read these volumes for himself.
He will find them, in the best
sense of the word, very amusing.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>
  <h2 class='c002'>THOMAS MOORE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The recent death of the Poet Moore
has rendered it incumbent on us, as
taking an interest in the literary
honour of the empire, to give a brief
sketch of his career. In this outline
we scarcely need say that we shall be
guided by the most perfect impartiality.
We have the due feeling for
the memory of genius, and the due
respect for the sacredness of the grave.
Though differing from Moore in political
opinions, we shall be willing to
give him the praise of sincerity; and,
though declining panegyric, we shall
with equal willingness give our tribute
to the talents which adorned his
country.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is to be hoped that a Memoir
will be supplied by some of those
friends to whose known ability such
a work can be intrusted; and with as
much of his personal correspondence,
and personal history, as may be consistent
with the feelings of his family
and the regard for his fame.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thomas Moore was born in Dublin
on the 30th of May 1780. His
parentage was humble; but it is the
glory of Britain to disregard pedigree,
where nature has given the ability
which leads to distinction.</p>

<p class='c010'>The period at which Moore first
came before the public eye was one
singularly exciting to Ireland. The
Civil War under James II. had left
bitterness in the Roman Catholic
mind, and the Penal Laws gave ample
topics for the declaimers. But, from
the commencement of the reign of
George III., those laws had undergone
a course of extinction, and all
the harsher parts of their pressure
were gradually abolished.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are not the panegyrists of those
laws; they erred, in making the <em>religious
belief</em> of the Romanist an object
of penalty. Faith, let it be of whatever
blindness, cannot be enlightened
by force of law. But we are to remember,
that the Irish Roman Catholics
had been in <em>arms</em> against their
sovereign; that they had shed English
blood in the quarrel of a religion
notoriously persecuting; that they
had brought foreign troops into the
country in aid of their rebellion; and
that they had formed an alliance with
France, then at war with England.
It was further to be remembered, that
in their Parliament under a returned
rebel, who had abdicated the throne
of both islands—and whose success
would have made Ireland a vassal, as
he himself was a pensioner, of France—they
had confiscated (against the
most solemn promises) the property
of two hundred leading Protestants,
and would have eventually confiscated
the whole property of Protestantism.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ireland had made itself a field of
battle, and the only relief for its
emergencies was to make it a <em>garrison</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wisdom of that measure was
shown in its fruits—the true test of
all statesmanship: Ireland remained
undisturbed for <em>seventy</em> years. During
the party and popular irritations of
the two first Brunswick reigns, during
the two Scottish invasions of 1715 and
1745, and during the American war,
Ireland was perfectly tranquil—certainly
not through loyalty, and as certainly
through law. At that time
there was no favoured party of agitation—no
faction suffered to clamour
itself into place, and the country into
tumult. There was no relaxation of
the laws of the land for scandalous
intrigue or insolent importunity. The
rule was strict, and strictly administered;
no manufacture of grievance
was permitted to give a livelihood to
a disturber, and no celebrity was in
the power of a demagogue, but the
ascent to the pillory. Common sense,
public justice, and vigilant law, were
the <em>triad</em> which governed Ireland, and
their fruits were seen in the most
rapid, vigorous, and extensive improvement
of the country. No kingdom
of Europe had ever so quickly
obliterated the traces of civil war.
Improvement was visible, in every
form of national progress. Ireland
had previously been a country of pasture,
and, of course, of depopulation:
it became a country of tillage. It had
formerly been totally destitute of commerce:
it now pushed its trade to the
thriving States of America, and grew
in wealth by the hour. It was formerly
compelled, by the want of native
manufactures, to purchase the clothing
of its population from England:
it now established the northern province
as an emporium of the linen
trade, which it still holds, and which
is more than a gold mine to a crowded
population.</p>

<p class='c010'>The increase of human life in Ireland
was perhaps the most memorable
in the annals of statistics. In the
beginning of the eighteenth century
the population was calculated at little
more than 700,000. It now started
forth by <em>millions</em>. And the national
increase of wealth, intelligence, and
public spirit, was shown in a manner
equally significant and singular.
Ireland had the honour of <em>inventing</em>
(if we may use the word) the Volunteers.
The threat of a French invasion
had alarmed the people, and
Parliament asked the important
question of the Viceroy, What forces
were provided for the defence of
the kingdom? His answer was,
that he had but 7000 men at his disposal.
The nation instantly determined
to take the defence on themselves,
and they raised an army such
as the world had never before seen—wholly
spontaneous in its rise, self-equipped,
serving without pay, self-disciplined—80,000
men ready for the
field!</p>

<p class='c010'>The armies of Greece and Rome,
even when republican, were <em>conscriptions</em>;
the <i><span lang="fr">levée en masse</span></i> in France
was compulsory, and the guillotine
was the recruiting officer; the gigantic
columns of the Imperial armies
were chiefly raised under the absolute
scourge. The <i><span lang="de">land-sturm</span></i> of the Germans
was created under the rigidity
of a system which drove the whole
population into the field—rightly and
righteously drove them; for what but
the low selfishness of brawling and
bustling Radicalism, or the petty
penury of superannuated avarice,
would declare it a hardship to defend
one’s own country, or hesitate to pay
the manly and necessary expenditure
which fitted them for that defence?
But Ireland, without hesitation,
and without stipulation—without
the pitiful pusillanimity of a weaver’s
soul and body, or the shrinking selfishness
of a pawnbroker in the shape
of a legislator—rushed to arms, and
scared away invasion!</p>

<p class='c010'>The expense of this illustrious effort
was enormous, the occupation of time
incalculable—but the act was heroic.
And let what will come, whether Ireland
is to have a career worthy of her
natural powers, or to perish under the
ascendancy of her deadly superstition,
that <em>act</em> will form the brightest jewel
in her historic diadem, as it will the
noblest inscription on her tomb. But
the whole effort implied the prosperity,
as well as the patriotism, of the kingdom.
Paupers cannot equip themselves
for the field. The country must
have had substantial resources to
meet the expenditure. The arming of
the volunteers would have exhausted
the treasury of half the sovereigns of
Europe, and yet the country bore it
freely, fearlessly, and without feeling
the slightest embarrassment in those
efforts which were at the moment
extending her interests through the
world.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have alluded to this fragment
of Irish history, because it illustrates
the system of fraud and falsehood
under which pretended patriotism in
Ireland has libelled, and continues to
libel, England—a system which talks
of peace, while it is perpetually provoking
hostility; which boasts of its
zeal for the country, while it is cutting
up every root of national hope; and
which is equally boastful in the streets,
and cowardly in the field.</p>

<p class='c010'>But another crisis came, and the
manliness of the national character
was to be tried in a still severer
emergency. The Penal Laws were
virtually extinguished, on the presumption
that Popery was reconcilable
by benefits, and that Irish patriotism
was not always the language
of conspiracy. The mistake was soon
discernible in a Popish League for the
subversion of the English Government.
The “United Irishmen”—a name in
itself a falsehood, for the object was
to crush one-half of the nation, by
establishing the tyranny of the other—were
formed into a League. But
the League was broken up, not in the
field, but in the dungeon, and the insurrection
was extinguished by the
executioner. Wolfe Tone, the Secretary
of the United Irishmen, came
over in a French ship of war, to
effect the <em>peaceful</em> liberation of his
“aggrieved country,” was imprisoned,
and cut his own throat. Lord Edward
Fitzgerald, the hero of novels, and
the martyr of poetry, lurked in the
capital, in the <em>soldierly</em> disguise of a
milkwoman, was taken in his bed,
wounded in the arrest, and died of the
wound. Not one of the leading conspirators
died in the field; all who
were not hanged begged their lives,
delivered up their secrets for their
own contemptible safety, and were
transported to America, there to recover
their courage, and wipe off
their shame, by libelling England.</p>

<p class='c010'>But among the most cruel acts of
those villains was the attempt to
involve the students of the University
in their crime. Their converts were
few, and those among the most obscure;
but those were effectually
ruined. A visitation was held under
the Lord Chancellor Clare, and the
delinquents were chiefly expelled.
On this occasion Moore was questioned.
His intimacy with the family
of the Emmetts, who seem all to have
been implicated in the charge, and his
peculiar intercourse with the unfortunate
and guilty Robert Emmett,
who, a few years after, was hanged
for open insurrection, rendered him
liable to suspicion. He was accordingly
examined at that formidable
tribunal. But his stature was so
undersized, his appearance so boyish,
and his answers were given with such
evident simplicity, that, to suppose
<em>him</em> intrusted with the secrets of
conspiracy, still less the sharer of a
sanguinary revolt, seemed next to
impossible, and he was dismissed
without animadversion. Thus the
future author of so many strains on
the slavery of Ireland, and the tyranny
of England, the publisher of
such stores—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Of fluent verse, and furious prose,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweet songster of fictitious woes”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>was “quitte pour la peur,” and sent
to receive the plaudits of his friends
for his firmness, and the cautions of his
own common sense with respect to
his intimacies for the future.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moore’s want of stature was an
actual misfortune to him through life,
which, though not shown with the
bitterness of Byron on his lameness,
must have been a source of perpetual
vexation in society. He was
one of the smallest men, perhaps, in
existence, above a dwarf. Yet he
was well-proportioned; and his lively
countenance, which looked the very
mirror of good-nature, aided by his
manners, which had by instinct the
grace of good society, made his figure,
after the first introduction, almost
forgotten. When he had established
his fame, of course, none adverted to
defects of any kind, and the “little
Tom Moore” of Ireland became the
Mr Moore of England, by the consent
of all circles. He possessed,
also, those gifts which create popularity.
The people of Ireland have
a remarkable fondness for music, and
Moore was a musician by nature.
Of music he knew nothing as a
science, but he felt its soul. The
heavy harmonies of Germany—in
which the chief object is to show the
toil of the performer and the patience
of his auditory, to press discords into
the service, and to crush the very
sense of pleasure—would not have
been endured by the Irish, who, like
all lovers of the genuine art, prefer
songs to musical problems, and to be
bewitched rather than be bewildered.
Moore, accordingly, cultivated the
finer part—its feeling. He has been
heard to say, “that if he had an original
turn for anything, it was for
music;” and he certainly produced, in
his earliest career, some of the most
original, tender, and tasteful melodies
in existence for the Piano, which
he touched with slight, but sufficient
skill; and, sung to his own soft and
sweet lines, he realised more of the
<em>magic</em> of music than any performer
whom we ever heard.</p>

<p class='c010'>This subject, however apparently
trivial, is not trifling in a Memoir of
Moore; for, independently of its being
his chief introduction into society, it
was a <em>characteristic</em> of the man. He
was the originator of a style, in which
he had many imitators, but no equal;
and after he abandoned it for other
means of shining, almost no follower.
It was neither Italian, nor, as
we have observed, German; it had
neither the frivolity of the French
school nor the wildness of the Irish;
it was exclusively his own—a mixture
of the playful and the pathetic;
sweet, and yet singular; light, and
yet often drawing tears. This effect,
the finest in music—for what taste
would compare a Sinfonia to a song?—he
accomplished by the admirable
management of a sweet voice, though
but of small compass, accompanied
by a few chords of the instrument,
rather filling up the intervals of the
voice than leading them: the whole
rather an exquisite recitation than a
song; the singer more the <em>minstrel</em>
than the <em>musician</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This description of his early powers,
however extravagant it may seem to
strangers, will be recognised as literally
true by those who heard him in
Ireland, and in the budding of his
talent. He was an <em>inventor</em>; his art
required the united taste of the composer
and the poet, and this accounts
for its having perished with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>But a larger field was soon to open
before Moore. The Rebellion of 1798
was a death-blow to the hopes of all
those sanguine speculators who longed
to become Presidents of the new republic.
It drained the national resources—it
disgusted the national
understanding—it made Ireland disunited,
and England at once contemptuous
of Irish feeling, and suspicious
of Irish loyalty. The safety
of the empire obviously rendered it
impossible to leave in its rear a nation
which might throw itself, at a moment’s
notice, into the arms of France, Spain,
or America—which had actually solicited
a French army, and which still
carried on transactions amounting to
treason at home, and alliance abroad.
Thus, the <em>regenerators</em> of Ireland, instead
of raising her to a republic, sank
her into a province. Even the dream
of national independence was at an
end; her Parliament was extinguished,
and the only reality was the <span class='sc'>Union</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still, though the national pride was
deeply hurt by the measure, the
graver judgment of the nation acquiesced
in the extinction of the Legislature.
This was the fruit of those
concessions which had been made by
the ignorance of Government, and demanded
by the intrigues of the Opposition.
From the period of lowering
the franchise to the Roman Catholic
forty-shilling freeholder, the votes of
the Romish peasantry became to the
Government a terror, to the Opposition
a snare, and to both, the
sources of a new policy. In a few
sessions more, the Parliament must
have become almost totally <em>Papist</em>.
Thus, after much declamation in
the clubs, and much murmuring in
the streets—after threats of declaring
the mover of the measure “an
enemy to his country”—and after
a duel between the celebrated Grattan,
the head of the Opposition, and
Corry, the Chancellor of the Irish
Exchequer, the diadem was taken off
the head of Ireland, and quietly
lodged in Whitehall. England thenceforth
became the field of Irish ambition,
and the mart of Irish ability.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moore came to London apparently
for the purpose of commencing his
studies as a barrister. Whether his
volatile and fanciful spirit would have
relished the details of a profession demanding
so much labour in its rudiments,
and so much perseverance in
its pursuit, is now not worth a question,
for he probably never opened a
book of law; but he had brought with
him a book of a more congenial kind;
a translation of <cite>Anacreon</cite>, to be published
by subscription, and dedicated
“by permission” to the Prince of
Wales, (George IV.,)—an honour
obtained, like all his early popularity,
through his musical accomplishments.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moore was not a scholar, in the
sense of a Markland or a Bentley; but
he had the best part of scholarship,
the spirit of his author. The elegance
of this versification of the old Greek
lover of “smiles and wine” was
universally acknowledged. All former
translations of <cite>Anacreon</cite> were poor
and pedantic, to the richness and
grace of the volume then offered to
the public eye.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whether the original was the work
of Ionia or Athens; whether one-half
of the Odes were not <em>imitations</em> in later
Greek, with Gregory Nazianzen and
a dozen others for their authors;
whether Polycrates or Hipparchus was
their patron—in short, the questions
which still perplex Oxford, and break
the rest of Cambridge—which drive
both into the logomachies of Teutonic
criticism, and waste English pens and
patience on the imported drudgeries
of the Leipsic press—were matters
which gave the translator but slight
trouble. Nature had created him for
the translation—the praises of wine
and beauty, of flowers and sunshine,
were a language of his own; they
formed his style through the greater
part of his life; and Cupid and Bacchus
never had a laureate more devoted,
and more successful.</p>

<p class='c010'>After lingering for some years in
London, fêted by the great and followed
by the little, Moore was appointed
to an office in the West Indies.
Thus was harshly hazarded the life of
a man of genius; and the talent which
was destined to distinguish his country
was sent to take its chance of the
yellow fever. The guest of princes
and the favourite of fashion must
have felt many a pang at finding
himself consigned to Bermuda. The
poetic romance of the “still vext
Bermoothes” was probably insufficient
to console him for the pavilion
at Brighton, and the soirees of Portman
Square. But necessity must not
deliberate—the <i><span lang="la">res angusta domi</span></i> was
imperative—and the bard submitted to
banishment with the grace and gaiety
that never forsook him. The appointment
was unfortunate. Connected
with the public revenue, it had been
transacted by deputy; and Moore, on
his arrival, found himself answerable
for the chasms in the official chest.
No one charged <em>him</em> with those
chasms. But, as the lawyers hold,
“the Crown makes no bad debts,” the
unlucky poet was responsible in a sum
which would have mortgaged all Parnassus,
and made the Nine insolvent.
The appointment was finally resigned,
and Moore, <i><span lang="la">solutus negotiis</span></i>, shook off
the dust of his feet against the gates
of the West Indies.</p>

<p class='c010'>Taking advantage of his proximity
to America, he now resolved to visit
the great Republic, Canada, and the
wonder of the Transatlantic world,
Niagara!</p>

<p class='c010'>America was made by Moore the
subject of some spirited poetry; but it
had another effect, less expected, yet
equally natural—it cured him of Republicanism.
The lofty superstitions
which haunt the sepulchres of Greece
and Rome, the angry ambition which
stimulated the Irish patriot into revolt,
or that fantasy of righting the
wrongs of all mankind, which put live
coals into the hands of the Frenchman
to heap on the altar of imaginary
freedom, were all extinguished by the
hard reality before his eyes. He
found the Americans, as all have
found them, vigorous, active, and
persevering in their own objects;
men of canals, corduroy roads, and
gigantic warehouses; sturdy reclaimers
of the swamp and the forest;
bold backwoodsmen, and shrewd citizens,
as they ought to be; but neither
poets nor painters, nor touched with
the tendernesses of romance, nor
penetrating the profound of philosophy.
Even their patriotism startled
the mourner over the sufferings of the
<cite>Isle of Saints</cite>; and the <cite>Ledger</cite>, more
honoured than the <cite>Legend</cite>, offended all
his reveries of a</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Paradise beyond the main,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unknown to lucre, lash, and chain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Even the habits of Republicanism
were found too primitive to be pleasing.
He had the honour of an interview
with Jefferson, then president;
and this “four years’ monarch” received
him in his nightgown and slippers,
and stretched at his length on a
sofa. Moore recoiled at this display
of <em>nonchalance</em>, and would have been
perfectly justified in turning on his
heel, and leaving this vulgarism to
the indulgence of “showing a Britisher”
the manners of a “free and
intelligent citizen.” This rough specimen
of freedom disgusted him, as
well it might; and though Republicanism
in rhyme might still amuse
his fancy, he evidently shrank from
the reality ever after.</p>

<p class='c010'>Canada increased his poetical
sketches. He wrote some spirited Odes
on its stern landscape, and some bitter
lines on the United States, in revenge
for its extinction of his dreams. But,
with America, he left all revolution
behind him, and never more cast a
“longing, lingering look” on the
subversion of thrones.</p>

<p class='c010'>On his return to Europe, he found
it necessary to consider into what
new path he was to turn. He had
long left the hope of shining on the
bench; office was now closed upon
him; authorship was his only resource;
and to authorship he turned
with all the quickness of his nature,
sharpened by the Roman’s</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“MAGISTER ARTIS, VENTER.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The exertion became more important
to him, from his having made a
disinterested match; and, in the spirit
of a poet, been contented to take
beauty as the marriage portion. He
now retired into the country, and
prepared for a life of vigorous authorship.
In this choice, he evidently
consulted his immediate circumstances
more than the natural direction of his
mind. Such a man was made for
cities; all his habits were social, and
he must have languished for society.
The cooing of doves and the songs
of nightingales were not the music
to accompany such verses as these—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Fly not yet, ’tis just the hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>When pleasure, like the midnight flower,</div>
      <div class='line'>That scorns the eye of vulgar light,</div>
      <div class='line'>Begins to bloom for sons of night,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And maids who love the moon.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>We can imagine the look of melancholy
with which, after having finished
his stanzas, Moore gave a moonlight
glance to the woods and wilds, as he
stood at his cottage door, and thought
of the lively scenes at that moment
glittering in London. Solitude may
be the place of the philosopher, and
universities the stronghold of science;
but, for the knowledge of life, the
play of character, the vigour of manly
competitorship, and even the variety
of views, events, and character, which
make the true materials of the poetic
faculty, association with our kind is indispensable.
The poet in retirement
either becomes the worship of a circle
of women, who pamper him with panegyric,
until he degenerates into silliness;
or, living alone, becomes the
worse thing—a worshipper of himself.
Like a garrison cut off from its supplies,
he lives on short allowance of
ideas; like a hermit, thinks his rags
sanctity, and his nonsense Oracles;
or, like Robinson Crusoe, imagines
his geese conversible, and his island
an empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is true, that Moore suffered less
from this famine of poetic food than
most of his race. His buoyancy of
spirit never lost sight wholly of London,
and his annual visit to the concerts
and conversations of Berkeley
Square, and other scenes of high life,
refreshed his recollections. But
when he tells us that <cite>Lalla Rookh</cite>
was written “amid the snows of two
or three Derbyshire winters,” and, in a
phraseology which seems like apologising
to himself for this exile, talks
of his “being enabled by that <em>concentration</em>
of thought, which <em>retirement
alone</em> can give, to call up around him
some of the sunniest of his Eastern
scenes,” the very toil and turgidity
of the language show us that he felt
himself in the <em>wrong</em> place.  In fact,
now that naked necks, turned-down
shirt-collars, and dishevelled hair, no
longer make poets <em>à la</em> Byron—when
even the white waistcoats of Young
England are no longer proof of chivalry—we
wish to save the innocent
hearts and fantastic heads of the rising
generation from the experiment
which Don Quixote performed so
little to the satisfaction of Sancho
Panza in the desert.  We never
heard of a great poet living a hundred
miles from a metropolis. Contiguity
to the world of men and women was
essential.  All the leaders of the
tribe lived as near London as they
could. Cowley lived within a walk,
Pope within a drive, Milton within
sight, of the walls—Shakspeare saw
London Bridge every day of his life—Dryden
lived in the Grecian Coffeehouse—Byron,
with his own goodwill,
never would have stirred out of
Bond Street; and when the newspapers
and Doctors’ Commons at
length drove him abroad, he nestled
down in Venice, instead of singing
among the slopes of the Apennines,
or acting distraction among the pinnacles
of the Alps. It is even not
improbable that the last few and
melancholy years of Moore’s life owed
some of their depression to the weariness
of this unnatural solitude.</p>

<p class='c010'>On his return from America in
1803, we lose sight of him for a while.
He was then probably harassed by
government transactions connected
with his luckless appointment; but
in 1805 he gave unhappy evidence of
his revival by the publication of
<cite>Poems by Mr Thomas Little</cite>.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have no desire to speak of this
work. Perhaps “his poverty, but
not his will,” was in fault. He made
some kind of apology at the time, by
attributing the performance “to an
imagination which had become the
slave of the passions;” and subsequently
he made the better apology
of excluding it from his collected
volumes. Yet, in this work, he did
less harm to society than injustice to
himself. The graver classes, of course,
repelled it at once; the fashionable
world took but little notice of a book
which could not be laid in their
drawing-rooms; and the profligate
could be but little excited by its
babyisms, for Moore’s amatory poems
were always babyish. They wanted,
in a remarkable degree, the fervency
of passion. They prattled rather
than felt: they babbled of lips and
eyes like an impudent child; their
Cupid was always an Urchin, and the
urchin was always in the nursery.
His verses of this school were flowing,
but they never rose above prettiness;
they never exhibited love in its living
reality—in its seriousness and power—its
madness of the brain, and absorption
of the soul—its overwhelming
raptures, and its terrible despair.
There is a deeper sense of the truth
and nature of <em>passion</em> in a single
ballad of Burns than in all the amatory
poems that Moore ever wrote.</p>

<p class='c010'>The injustice to himself consisted
in his thus leaving it in the hands of
every stranger, to connect the life of
the man with the licentiousness of the
author. Yet we have never heard
that his life was other than decorous;
his conversation certainly never offended
general society—his manners
were polished—and we believe that
his mind was at all times innocent of
evil intention. Still, these poems
threw a long shade on the gentle
lustre of his fame.</p>

<p class='c010'>He now fell under the lash of the
<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, never more sternly,
and seldom so justly, exercised.
Moore indignantly sent a message to
the editor. Jeffrey, refusing to give
up the name of the Zoilus in disguise,
accepted the message, and the
parties met. Fortunately some friend,
with more sense than either, sent
also <em>his</em> message, but it was to the
Bow Street magistrates, and the belligerents
were captured on the field.
In conveying the instruments of war
to Bow Street, the bullets had fallen
out; and this circumstance was, of
course, too comic to be forgotten by
the wits. The press shot forth its
epigrams, the point of which was the
harmlessness of the hostilities. It
was observed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That the pistols were leadless</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Is no sort of news,</div>
      <div class='line'>For <em>blank</em>-cartridge should always</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Be fired at <em>Reviews</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>We transcribe but another squib.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A Scotchman and Irishman went out to fight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Both equal in fierceness, both equal in fright;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not a pin, ’twixt the heroes, in valour to choose,</div>
      <div class='line'>The son of the <em>Scissors</em>, and son of the Muse.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The whole affair was an illustration
of the barbaric absurdity of duelling.
Lord Brougham was subsequently
supposed to be the layer on of the
critical lash. If Jeffrey had given
him up, Moore would have shot him
if he could; and if Brougham had
survived, he would have shot Jeffrey.
Thus, two of the cleverest men of
their day might have been victims to
the bastard chivalry of the nineteenth
century. How Moore himself would
have fared in the fray, no one can
tell; but being as honourably savage
as any of his countrymen, and as untameable
as a tiger-cat, he would certainly
have shot somebody, or got
pistolled himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>His next work was an opera. This
attempt did not encourage him in trial
of the stage. It had but a brief existence.
Moore, though lively, was
not a wit; and though inventive, was
not dramatic. The inimitable “Duenna”
of the inimitable Sheridan has
expelled all Opera from the English
stage, by extinguishing all rivalry.</p>

<p class='c010'>But a broader opportunity now
spread before him. A musical collector
in Ireland had compiled a volume
of the Native melodies, which,
though generally rude in science, and
always accompanied by the most
aboriginal versification, attracted
some publicity. Moore, in his happiest
hour, glanced over these songs,
and closed with the proposal of a publisher
in Ireland to write the poetry,
and bring the melodies themselves into
a <em>civilised</em> form. The latter object he
effected by the assistance of Stevenson,
an accomplished musician, and even a
popular composer: the former might
be safely intrusted to himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is to be remembered (though
Ireland may be wroth to the bottom
of its sensibilities) that its most
remote musical pedigree falls within
the last century; that all beyond is
shared with Scotland; and that the
harmonies which Ossian shook from
his harp, and which rang in the
palaces of Fingal, and the nursing of
Romulus and Remus, have equal
claims to authenticity. Beyond the
last century, the claims of Ireland to
music were disputed by Scotland; and
there was a species of partnership in
their popular airs. But the true musician
of Ireland was Carolan, a blind
man who wandered about the houses
of the country gentlemen, like Scott’s
minstrel, except that his patriotism
was less prominent than his love of
eating and drinking. He thought
more of pay than of Party, and
limited his Muse to her proper subjects—Love
and Wine. But he was
a musician by nature, and therefore
worth ten thousand by art; and the
finest melodies in Moore’s portfolio
were the product of a mind which
had no master, and no impulse but its
genius.</p>

<p class='c010'>Time had not weaned Moore from
the absurdity of imagining that every
rebel must be a hero, or that men
who universally begged their lives,
or died by the rope, were the true
regenerators of the country. His
early connection with the Emmett
family had been distressingly renewed
by the execution of Robert Emmett,
justly punished for a combination of
folly and wickedness, perhaps without
example in the narratives of impotent
convulsion. Emmett was a barrister,
struggling through the first difficulties
of his difficult profession, when somebody
left him a luckless legacy of five
hundred pounds. He laid it all out
in powder and placards, and resolved
to “make a Rebellion.” Without
any one man of note to join him,
without even any one patron or member
of faction to give the slightest
assistance, without any one hope but
in <em>miracle</em>, he undertook to overthrow
the Government, to crush the army,
to extinguish the Constitution, to remodel
the Aristocracy, to scourge the
Church, to abolish the throne, and,
having achieved these easy matters,
to place Mr Robert Emmett on
the summit of Irish empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Accordingly, he purchased a green
coat with a pair of gold epaulettes;
rushed from a hovel in a back street,
at the head of about fifty vagabonds
with pikes; was met and beaten by a
party of yeomanry going to parade;
ran away with his <em>army</em>; hid himself
in the vicinity of Dublin for a few
days; was hunted out, and was tried
and hanged. Those are the actual
features of the transaction, where
poetry has done its utmost to blazon
the revolt, and partisanship has lavished
its whole budget of lies on the
heroism of the revolter; those <em>are</em> the
facts, and the only facts, of Mr Robert
Emmett’s revolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moore made his full advantage of
the disturbances of the time; and it
must be allowed that they wonderfully
improved his poetry. Their
strong reality gave it a strength which
it never possessed before, and the
imaginary poutings of boys and girls
were vividly exchanged for the imaginary
grievances of men. What can
be more animated than these lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, for the swords of former time!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oh, for the men who bore them!</div>
      <div class='line'>When, armed for Right, they stood sublime,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And tyrants crouched before them.</div>
      <div class='line'>When, pure yet, ere courts began</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With honours to enslave him,</div>
      <div class='line'>The best honours worn by man,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Were those which virtue gave him.</div>
      <div class='line in12'>Oh, for the swords, &#38;c.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Or this—</p>

<h3 class='c020'>LAMENT.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Forget not the field where they perished,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The truest, the last of the brave!</div>
      <div class='line'>All gone, and the bright hope we cherished</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Gone with them, and quenched in their grave.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, could we from Death but recover</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Those hearts as they bounded before,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the face of high heaven to fight over</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This combat for freedom once more.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The phrase used in the speeches of
the late “Agitator,” till it grew ridiculous
by the repetition, will be found
in the following fine lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Remember thee! yes, while there’s life in this heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>It shall never forget thee, all lorn as thou art,</div>
      <div class='line'>More dear in thy sorrow, thy gloom and thy showers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than the rest of the world in their sunniest hours.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wert thou all that I wish thee, great, glorious, and free,</div>
      <div class='line'><em>First flower of the earth, and first gem of the sea</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>I might hail thee with prouder, with happier brow,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, oh, could I love thee more deeply than now?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No! thy chains, as they rankle, thy blood, as it runs,</div>
      <div class='line'>But make thee more painfully dear to thy sons,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose hearts, like the young of the desert-bird’s nest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Drink love in each life-drop that flows from thy breast.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It would be <em>cruel</em> to ask for the
evidence of all this tyranny—a link of
the chains that rankle on the limbs
of Ireland, or a drop of the blood that
so perpetually oozes from her wounds.
But poetry is privileged to be as “unhappy”
as it pleases—to weep over
sorrows unfelt by the world—and to
fabricate wrongs, only to have the
triumph of sweeping them away.
We would tolerate half the harangues
of the Irish disturbers for
one poet like Moore.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the most finished of those
verses were devoted to the memory
of Emmett, and they could not have
been devoted to a subject more unworthy
of his poetry. In Ireland,
for the last five hundred years, every
fault, folly, and failure of the nation
is laid to the charge of England.
The man who <em>invents</em> a “grievance” is
sure to be popular; but if he is to
achieve the supreme triumph of popularity,
he must fasten his grievance
on the back of England; and if he
pushes his charge into practice, and
is ultimately banished or hanged, he
is canonised in the popular calendar
of patriotism. This absurdity, equally
unaccountable and incurable, actually
places Emmett in the rank of the
Wallaces and Kosciuskos;—thus degrading
men of conduct and courage,
encountering great hazards for great
principles, with a selfish simpleton, a
trifler with conspiracy, and a runaway
from the first sight of the danger
which he himself had created. Moore’s
hero was a feeble romancer; his national
regenerator a street rioter;
and his patriotic statesman merely a
giddy gambler, who staked his pittance
on a silly and solitary throw for supremacy,
and saw his stake swept
away by the policeman! Totally
foolish as Ireland has ever been in
her politics, she ought to be most
ashamed of this display before the
world—of inaugurating this stripling-revolutionist,
this fugitive champion,
this milk-and-water Jacobin, among
her claims to the homage of posterity.
Yet this was the personage on whose
death Moore wrote these touching
lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O breathe not his name, let it sleep in the shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where cold and unhonoured his relics are laid;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sad, silent, and dark, be the tears that we shed,</div>
      <div class='line'>As the night-dew that falls on the grass o’er his head.</div>
      <div class='line'>But the night-dew that falls, though in silence it weeps,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still brightens with verdure the grave where he sleeps,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the tear that we shed, though in secret it rolls,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall long keep his memory green in our souls.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>On the death of the celebrated
Richard Brinsley Sheridan, some of
his Notes and Manuscripts were put
into Moore’s hands, and the alliance
constituted by the Whiggism of
both was presumed to insure a satisfactory
tribute to the remembrance
of perhaps the most gifted man of
the age. But their Whiggism was
different; Sheridan’s was party, and
Moore’s was prejudice. Sheridan had
put on and off his Whiggism, with
the grave affectation, or the sarcastic
ease, of one who knew its worthlessness;
Moore adopted it with the simplicity
of ignorance, and the blind
passion of the native character. The
result was, a biography that pleased
no one. Those whom Sheridan had
lashed in the House of Commons,
thought that it was too laudatory;
while his admirers charged it with
injustice. However, to those who
cared nothing for the partisanship of
either, the volume was amusing, occasionally
eloquent, though less anecdotical
than was to be expected from
a career almost <em>one anecdote</em> from
the beginning. On the whole, it sustained
Moore’s reputation.</p>

<p class='c010'>His <cite>Life of Byron</cite>, at a later period,
had an increased popularity. The
subject was singularly difficult;
Byron had provoked a quarrel with
the world, and was proud of the provocation.
He had led a career of
private petulance, which was deeply
offensive to individuals, and he disclaimed
all respect for those higher
decorums which society demands.
The power of his verse had thrown a
shield over the living poet, but a
severe tribunal apparently awaited
the dead. Moore accomplished his
task with dexterity, judicious selection,
and still more judicious suppression,
were exercised; and he was
enabled to produce a performance at
once faithful to the fame of the dead,
and free from insult to the living.</p>

<p class='c010'>A more reluctant glance must be
given to Moore’s political writings.
In this unhappy digression from the
natural pursuits of a poet, Moore
showed all the <em>monomania</em> of the
Irish Papist. England is now familiar
with the singular contradiction of
fact to phrase, which exists in all the
partisanship of Ireland. The first
principle of the modern orator in Ireland
is a reckless defiance of the
common sense of mankind; facts fly
before him, and truths are trampled
under his heel. In the most insolent
challenges to the law, he complains
that he is tongue-tied; in the most
extravagant license of libel, he complains
of oppression; and in the most
daring outrage against authority, he
complains that he is a <em>slave</em>! Summoning
public meetings for the purpose
of extinguishing the Government,
and summoning them with <em>impunity</em>,
he pronounces the Government to be
a tyrant, and the land a dungeon.
The reader who would conceive the
condition of Ireland from its Papist
speakers must think that he is listening
to the annals of Norfolk Island,
or the mysteries of a French <i><span lang="fr">oubliette</span></i>.
Moore’s politics shared the <em>monomania</em>
of his Popish countrymen.</p>

<p class='c010'>But he suddenly turned to more
congenial objects, and produced his
popular poem of <cite>Lalla Rookh</cite>. The
scenery of India gave full opportunity
to the luxuriance of his style;
the wildness of Indian adventure, and
the novelty of Indian romance, excited
public curiosity, and the volume
found its way into every drawing-room,
and finally rested in every
library. But there its course ended;
the glitter which at first dazzled, at
length exhausted, the public eye. We
might as well look with unwearied
delight on a piece of tissue, and be
satisfied with vividness of colour, in
place of vividness of form. Moore’s
future fame will depend on his <cite>National
Melodies</cite>.</p>

<p class='c010'>He received large sums for some of
his volumes; but what are occasional
successes, when their products must
be expanded over a life! He always
expressed himself as in narrow circumstances,
and his retired mode of living
seemed to justify the expression.
Towards the close of his days, his
friend the Marquis of Lansdowne
obtained for him a pension of £300
a-year. But he had not long enjoyed
this important accession to his income
before his faculties began to fail.
His memory was the first to give way;
he lingered, in increasing decay, for
about two years, till on the 26th of February
he died, at the age of nearly 72.</p>

<p class='c010'>His funeral took place in a neighbouring
churchyard, where one of
his daughters was buried. It was so
strictly and so unnecessarily private
that but two or three persons attended,
of the many who, we believe,
would have willingly paid the last
respect to his remains.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus has passed away a great poet
from the world—a man whose manners
added grace to every circle in
which he moved—animation to the
gay, and sentiment to the refined. If
England holds his remains, Ireland is
the heir of his fame; and if she has a
sense of gratitude, she will give some
public testimonial of her homage to
the genius which has given another
ray to the lustre of her name.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>BOOK XI.—INITIAL CHAPTER.</h3>

<p class='c022'>It is not an uncommon crotchet
amongst benevolent men to maintain
that wickedness is necessarily a sort
of insanity, and that nobody would
make a violent start out of the straight
path unless stung to such disorder by
a bee in his bonnet. Certainly, when
some very clever, well-educated person,
like our friend, Randal Leslie,
acts upon the fallacious principle that
“roguery is the best policy,” it is
curious to see how many points he
has in common with the insane: what
over-cunning—what irritable restlessness—what
suspicious belief that the
rest of the world are in a conspiracy
against him, which it requires all his
wit to baffle and turn to his own proper
aggrandisement and profit. Perhaps
some of my readers may have
thought that I have represented Randal
as unnaturally far-fetched in his
schemes, too wire-drawn and subtle
in his speculations; yet that is commonly
the case with very refining
intellects, when they choose to play
the knave;—it helps to disguise from
themselves the ugliness of their ambition,
just as a philosopher delights in
the ingenuity of some metaphysical
process, which ends in what plain
men call “atheism,” who would be
infinitely shocked and offended if he
were entitled an atheist. As I have
somewhere said or implied before, it
is difficult for us dull folks to conceive
the glee which a wily brain takes in
the exercise of its own ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having premised thus much on behalf
of the “Natural” in Randal
Leslie’s character, I must here fly off
to say a word or two on the agency
in human life exercised by a passion
rarely seen without a mask in our
debonnair and civilised age—I mean
Hate.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the good old days of our forefathers,
when plain speaking and hard
blows were in fashion—when a man
had his heart at the tip of his tongue,
and four feet of sharp iron dangling
at his side, Hate played an honest,
open part in the theatre of the world.
In fact, when we read history, it
seems to have “starred it” on the
stage. But now, where is Hate?—who
ever sees its face? Is it that
smiling, good-tempered creature, that
presses you by the hand so cordially?
or that dignified figure of state that
calls you its “right honourable friend?”
Is it that bowing, grateful dependant?—is
it that soft-eyed Amaryllis?
Ask not, guess not; you will only
know it to be Hate when the poison
is in your cup, or the poniard in
your breast. In the Gothic age, grim
Humour painted “the Dance of
Death;” in our polished century,
some sardonic wit should give us
“the Masquerade of Hate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Certainly, the counter-passion betrays
itself with ease to our gaze.
Love is rarely a hypocrite. But Hate—how
detect, and how guard against it?
It lurks where you least suspect it;
it is created by causes that you can the
least foresee; and Civilisation multiplies
its varieties, whilst it favours
its disguise: for Civilisation increases
the number of contending interests,
and Refinement renders more susceptible
to the least irritation the cuticle
of Self-Love. But Hate comes covertly
forth from some self-interest we have
crossed, or some self-love we have
wounded; and, dullards that we are,
how seldom we are aware of our
offence! You may be hated by a man
you have never seen in your life; you
may be hated as often by one you
have loaded with benefits;—you may
so walk as not to tread on a worm;
but you must sit fast on your easy-chair
till you are carried out to your
bier, if you would be sure not to tread
on some snake of a foe. But, then,
what harm does the Hate do us?
Very often the harm is as unseen by
the world as the hate is unrecognised
by us. It may come on us, unawares,
in some solitary byway of our life;
strike us in our unsuspecting privacy;
thwart us in some blessed hope we have
never told to another: for the moment
the world sees that it is Hate that
strikes us, its worst power of mischief
is gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have a great many names for
the same passion—Envy, Jealousy,
Spite, Prejudice, Rivalry; but they
are so many synonyms for the one old
heathen demon. When the death-giving
shaft of Apollo sent the plague
to some unhappy Achæan, it did not
much matter to the victim whether
the god were called Helios or Smintheus.</p>

<p class='c010'>No man you ever met in the world
seemed more raised above the malice
of Hate than Audley Egerton: even
in the hot war of politics he had
scarcely a personal foe; and in private
life he kept himself so aloof and
apart from others that he was little
known, save by the benefits the waste
of his wealth conferred. That the
hate of any one could reach the
austere statesman on his high pinnacle
of esteem,—you would have
smiled at the idea! But Hate is now,
as it ever has been, an actual Power
amidst “the Varieties of Life;” and,
in spite of bars to the door, and policemen
in the street, no one can be
said to sleep in safety while there
wakes the eye of a single foe.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class='c022'>The glory of Bond Street is no
more. The title of Bond Street
Lounger has faded from our lips. In
vain the crowd of equipages and the
blaze of shops: the renown of Bond
Street was in its pavement—its pedestrians.
Art thou old enough, O
reader! to remember the Bond Street
Lounger and his incomparable generation?
For my part, I can just recall
the decline of the grand era. It was
on its wane when, in the ambition of
boyhood, I first began to muse upon
high neckcloths and Wellington boots.
But the ancient <em>habitués</em>—the <i><span lang="la">magni
nominis umbræ</span></i>—contemporaries of
Brummell in his zenith—boon companions
of George IV. in his regency—still
haunted the spot. From four
to six in the hot month of June, they
sauntered stately to and fro, looking
somewhat mournful even then—foreboding
the extinction of their race.
The Bond Street Lounger was rarely
seen alone: he was a social animal,
and walked arm in arm with his
fellow-man. He did not seem born
for the cares of these ruder times;
not made was he for an age in which
Finsbury returns members to Parliament.
He loved his small talk; and
never since then has talk been so
pleasingly small. Your true Bond
Street Lounger had a very dissipated
look. His youth had been spent with
heroes who loved their bottle. He
himself had perhaps supped with
Sheridan. He was by nature a spendthrift:
you saw it in the roll of his
walk. Men who make money rarely
saunter; men who save money rarely
swagger. But saunter and swagger
both united to stamp <span class='fss'>PRODIGAL</span> on
the Bond Street Lounger. And so
familiar as he was with his own set,
and so amusingly supercilious with
the vulgar residue of mortals whose
faces were strange to Bond Street.
But He is gone. The world, though
sadder for his loss, still strives to do
its best without him; and our young
men, now-a-days, attend to model
cottages, and incline to Tractarianism—I
mean those young men who are
quiet and harmless, as a Bond Street
Lounger was of old—<i><span lang="la">redeant Saturnia
regna</span></i>. Still the place, to an unreflecting
eye, has its brilliancy and
bustle. But it is a thoroughfare, not
a lounge. And adown the thoroughfare,
somewhat before the hour when
the throng is thickest, passed two
gentlemen of an appearance exceedingly
out of keeping with the place.
Yet both had the air of men pretending
to aristocracy—an old-world air
of respectability and stake in the
country, and Church-and-Stateism.
The burlier of the two was even
rather a beau in his way. He had first
learned to dress, indeed, when Bond
Street was at its acmé, and Brummell
in his pride. He still retained in
his garb the fashion of his youth; only
what then had spoken of the town,
now betrayed the life of the country.
His neckcloth ample and high, and of
snowy whiteness, set off to comely
advantage a face smooth-shaven,
and of clear, florid hues; his coat of
royal blue, with buttons in which you
might have seen yourself <i><span lang="la">veluti in
speculum</span></i>, was, rather jauntily, buttoned
across a waist that spoke of
lusty middle age, free from the ambition,
the avarice, and the anxieties
that fret Londoners into thread-papers;
his smallclothes of greyish drab, loose
at the thigh and tight at the knee,
were made by Brummell’s own
breeches-maker, and the gaiters to
match (thrust half-way down the
calf) had a manly dandyism that
would have done honour to the beau-ideal
of a county member. The profession
of this gentleman’s companion
was unmistakable—the shovel-hat,
the clerical cut of the coat, the neckcloth
without collar, that seemed
made for its accessory—the band, and
something very decorous, yet very
mild, in the whole mien of this personage,
all spoke of one who was
every inch the gentleman and the
parson.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said the portlier of these
two persons—“no, I can’t say I
like Frank’s looks at all. There’s
certainly something on his mind.
However, I suppose it will be all out
this evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He dines with you at your hotel,
Squire? Well, you must be kind to
him. We can’t put old heads upon
young shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t object to his head being
young,” returned the Squire; “but I
wish he had a little of Randal Leslie’s
good sense in it. I see how it will
end: I must take him back into the
country; and if he wants occupation,
why, he shall keep the hounds, and
I’ll put him into Brooksby farm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As for the hounds,” replied the
Parson, “hounds necessitate horses;
and I think more mischief comes to a
young man of spirit, from the stables,
than from any other place in the
world. They ought to be exposed
from the pulpit, those stables!” added
Mr Dale thoughtfully; “see what
they entailed upon Nimrod! But
agriculture is a healthful and noble
pursuit, honoured by sacred nations,
and cherished by the greatest men in
classical times. For instance, the
Athenians were—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bother the Athenians!” cried the
Squire irreverently; “you need not
go so far back for an example. It is
enough for a Hazeldean that his father
and his grandfather and his great-grandfather
all farmed before him;
and a devilish deal better, I take it,
than any of those musty old Athenians—no
offence to them. But I’ll
tell you one thing, Parson—a man,
to farm well, and live in the country,
should have a wife; it is half the
battle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As to a battle, a man who is married
is pretty sure of half, though not
always the better half, of it,” answered
the Parson, who seemed peculiarly
facetious that day. “Ah, Squire, I
wish I could think Mrs Hazeldean
right in her conjecture!—you would
have the prettiest daughter-in-law in
the three kingdoms. And I think, if I
could have a good talk with the young
lady apart from her father, we could
remove the only objection I know to
the marriage. Those Popish errors—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, very true!” cried the Squire;
“that Pope sticks hard in my gizzard.
I could excuse her being a foreigner,
and not having, I suppose, a shilling
in her pocket—bless her handsome
face!—but to be worshipping images
in her room instead of going to the
parish church, that will never do.
But you think you could talk her out
of the Pope, and into the family
pew?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, I could have talked her
father out of the Pope, only, when he
had not a word to say for himself, he
bolted out of the window. Youth is
more ingenuous in confessing its errors.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I own,” said the Squire, “that both
Harry and I had a favourite notion
of ours, till this Italian girl got into
our heads. Do you know we both
took a great fancy to Randal’s little
sister—pretty, blushing, English-faced
girl as ever you saw. And it went to
Harry’s good heart to see her so
neglected by that silly, fidgetty mother
of hers, her hair hanging about
her ears; and I thought it would be
a fine way to bring Randal and Frank
more together, and enable me to do
something for Randal himself—a good
boy, with Hazeldean blood in his
veins. But Violante is so handsome,
that I don’t wonder at the boy’s
choice; and then it is our fault—we
let them see so much of each other,
as children. However, I should be
very angry if Rickeybockey had been
playing sly, and running away from
the Casino in order to give Frank an
opportunity to carry on a clandestine
intercourse with his daughter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think that would be like
Riccabocca; more like him to run
away in order to deprive Frank of
the best of all occasions to court Violante,
if he so desired; for where
could he see more of her than at the
Casino?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“That’s well put. Considering
he was only a foreign doctor,
and, for aught we know, went about
in a caravan, he is a gentlemanlike
fellow, that Rickeybockey. I speak of
people as I find them. But what is
your notion about Frank? I see you
don’t think he is in love with Violante,
after all. Out with it, man;
speak plain.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“Since you so urge me,
I own I do not think him in love with
her; neither does my Carry, who is
uncommonly shrewd in such matters.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“Your Carry, indeed!—as
if she were half as shrewd as my
Harry. Carry—nonsense!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson</span>, (reddening.)—“I don’t
want to make invidious remarks; but,
Mr Hazeldean, when you sneer at
my Carry, I should not be a man if I
did not say that—”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire</span>, (interrupting.)—“She was
a good little woman enough; but to
compare her to my Harry!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“I don’t compare her to
your Harry; I don’t compare her to
any woman in England, sir. But
you are losing your temper, Mr
Hazeldean!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“I!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“And people are staring
at you, Mr Hazeldean. For decency’s
sake, compose yourself, and
change the subject. We are just at
the Albany. I hope that we shall
not find poor Captain Higginbotham
as ill as he represents himself in his
letter. Ah! is it possible? No, it
cannot be. Look—look!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“Where—what—where?
Don’t pinch so hard. Bless me, do
you see a ghost?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“There—the gentleman
in black!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“Gentleman in black!
What!—in broad daylight! Nonsense!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the Parson made a spring
forward, and, catching the arm of the
person in question, who himself had
stopped, and was gazing intently on
the pair, exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir, pardon me; but is not your
name Fairfield? Ah, it is Leonard—it
is—my dear, dear boy! What
joy! So altered, so improved, but
still the same honest face. Squire,
come here—your old friend, Leonard
Fairfield.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And he wanted to persuade me,”
said the Squire, shaking Leonard
heartily by the hand, “that you
were the gentleman in black; but, indeed,
he has been in strange humours
and tantrums all the morning. Well,
Master Lenny; why, you are grown
quite a gentleman! The world thrives
with you—eh! I suppose you are
head-gardener to some grandee.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not that, sir,” said Leonard smiling.
“But the world has thriven
with me at last, though not without
some rough usage at starting. Ah,
Mr Dale, you can little guess how
often I have thought of you and your
discourse on Knowledge; and, what
is more, how I have lived to feel the
truth of your words, and to bless the
lesson.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson</span>, (much touched and flattered.)—“I
expected nothing less of
you, Leonard; you were always a lad
of great sense, and sound judgment.
So you have thought of my little discourse
on Knowledge, have you?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“Hang knowledge! I
have reason to hate the word. It
burned down three ricks of mine;
the finest ricks you ever set eyes on,
Mr Fairfield.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“That was not knowledge,
Squire; that was ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“Ignorance! The deuce
it was. I’ll just appeal to you, Mr
Fairfield. We have been having
sad riots in the shire, and the ringleader
was just such another lad as
you were!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Leonard.</span>—“I am very much
obliged to you, Mr Hazeldean. In
what respect?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“Why, he was a village
genius, and always reading some
cursed little tract or other; and got
mighty discontented with King, Lords,
and Commons, I suppose, and went
about talking of the wrongs of the
poor, and the crimes of the rich, till,
by Jove, sir, the whole mob rose one
day with pitchforks and sickles, and
smash went Farmer Smart’s thrashing-machines;
and on the same night
my ricks were on fire. We caught
the rogues, and they were all tried;
but the poor deluded labourers were
let off with a short imprisonment.
The village genius, thank heaven, is
sent packing to Botany Bay.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Leonard.</span>—“But, did his books
teach him to burn ricks, and smash
machines?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“No; he said quite the
contrary, and declared that he had
no hand in those misdoings.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“But he was proved to
have excited, with his wild talk, the
boobies who had! ’Gad, sir, there
was a hypocritical Quaker once, who
said to his enemy, ‘I can’t shed thy
blood, friend, but I will hold thy head
under water till thou art drowned.’
And so there is a set of demagogical
fellows, who keep calling out, ‘Farmer
This is an oppressor, and Squire
That is a vampire! But no violence!
Don’t smash their machines, don’t
burn their ricks! Moral force, and a
curse on all tyrants!’ Well, and if
poor Hodge thinks moral force is all
my eye, and that the recommendation
is to be read backwards, in the
devil’s way of reading the Lord’s
Prayer, I should like to know which
of the two ought to go to Botany
Bay—Hodge who comes out like a
man, if he thinks he is wronged, or
’tother sneaking chap, who makes
use of his knowledge to keep himself
out of the scrape?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“It may be very true;
but when I saw that poor fellow at
the bar, with his intelligent face, and
heard his bold clear defence, and
thought of all his hard straggles for
knowledge, and how they had ended,
because he forgot that knowledge is
like fire, and must not be thrown
amongst flax—why, I could have
given my right hand to save him.
And, oh Squire, do you remember
his poor mother’s shriek of despair
when he was sentenced to transportation
for life—I hear it now! And
what, Leonard—what do you think
had misled him? At the bottom of
all the mischief was a Tinker’s bag.
You cannot forget Sprott?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Leonard.</span>—“Tinker’s bag!—Sprott!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“That rascal, sir, was
the hardest fellow to nab you could
possibly conceive; as full of quips
and quirks as an Old Bailey lawyer.
But we managed to bring it
home to him. Lord! his bag was
choke-full of tracts against every man
who had a good coat on his back;
and as if that was not enough, cheek
by jowl with the tracts were lucifers,
contrived on a new principle, for teaching
my ricks the theory of spontaneous
combustion. The labourers bought
the lucifers—”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“And the poor village
genius bought the tracts.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“All headed with a
motto—‘To teach the working-classes
that knowledge is power.’ So
that I was right in saying that knowledge
had burnt my ricks; knowledge
inflamed the village genius, the village
genius inflamed fellows more
ignorant than himself, and they inflamed
my stackyard. However,
lucifers, tracts, village genius, and
Sprott, are all off to Botany Bay;
and the shire has gone on much the
better for it. So no more of your
knowledge for me, begging your
pardon, Mr Fairfield. Such uncommonly
fine ricks as mine were, too!
I declare, Parson, you are looking as
if you felt pity for Sprott; and I
saw you, indeed, whispering to him
as he was taken out of court.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson</span>, (looking sheepish.)—“Indeed,
Squire, I was only asking
him what had become of his donkey,
an unoffending creature.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“Unoffending! Upset
me amidst a thistle-bed in my
own village green. I remember it.
Well, what did he say <em>had</em> become of
the donkey?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“He said but one word;
but that showed all the vindictiveness
of his disposition. He said it with a
horrid wink, that made my blood
run cold. ‘What’s become of your
poor donkey?’ said I, and he answered—”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“Go on. He answered—”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“‘Sausages.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“Sausages! Like enough;
and sold to the poor; and that’s what
the poor will come to if they listen to
such revolutionising villains. Sausages!
Donkey sausages!—(spitting)—’Tis
as bad as eating one another;
perfect cannibalism.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Leonard, who had been thrown
into grave thought by the history
of Sprott and the village genius,
now pressing the Parson’s hand,
asked permission to wait on him
before Mr Dale quitted London; and
was about to withdraw, when the
Parson, gently detaining him, said—“No;
don’t leave me yet, Leonard—I
have so much to ask you, and to
talk about. I shall be at leisure
shortly. We are just now going to call
on a relation of the Squire’s, whom
you must recollect, I am sure—Captain
Higginbotham—Barnabas Higginbotham.
He is very poorly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I am sure he would take it
kind in you to call too,” said the
Squire with great good-nature.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Leonard.</span>—“Nay, sir, would not
that be a great liberty?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“Liberty! To ask a poor
sick gentleman how he is? Nonsense.
And I say, sir, perhaps, as no doubt
you have been living in town, and
know more of newfangled notions
than I do—perhaps you can tell us
whether or not it is all humbug, that
new way of doctoring people?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What new way, sir? There are
so many.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are there? Folks in London do
look uncommonly sickly. But my
poor cousin (he was never a Solomon)
has got hold, he says, of a
homey—homely—What’s the word,
Parson?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“ Homœopathist.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“That’s it! You see the
Captain went to live with one Sharpe
Currie, a relation who had a great deal
of money, and very little liver;—made
the one, and left much of the other in
Ingee, you understand. The Captain
had <em>expectations</em> of the money. Very
natural, I dare say; but Lord, sir!
what do you think has happened?
Sharpe Currie has done him! Would
not die, sir; got back his liver, and
the Captain has lost his own.
Strangest thing you ever heard. And
then the ungrateful old Nabob has
dismissed the Captain, saying, ‘He
can’t bear to have invalids about him;’
and is going to marry, and I have
no doubt will have children by the
dozen!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“It was in Germany,
at one of the Spas, that Mr Currie
recovered; and as he had the selfish
inhumanity to make the Captain go
through a course of waters simultaneously
with himself, it has so
chanced that the same waters that
cured Mr Currie’s liver have destroyed
Captain Higginbotham’s.
An English homœopathic physician,
then staying at the Spa, has attended
the Captain hither, and declares that
he will restore him by infinitesimal
doses of the same chemical properties
that were found in the waters which
diseased him. Can there be anything
in such a theory?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Leonard.</span>—“I once knew a very
able, though eccentric homœopathist,
and I am inclined to believe there
may be something in the system.
My friend went to Germany: it may
possibly be the same person who
attends the Captain. May I ask his
name?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“Cousin Barnabas does
not mention it. You may ask it of
himself, for here we are at his chambers.
I say, Parson, (whispering
slily,) if a small dose of what hurt
the Captain is to cure him, don’t you
think the proper thing would be a—legacy?
Ha! ha!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson</span>, (trying not to laugh.)—“Hush,
Squire. Poor human
nature! We must be merciful to its
infirmities. Come in, Leonard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Leonard, interested in his doubt
whether he might thus chance again
upon Dr Morgan, obeyed the invitation,
and with his two companions
followed the woman—who “did for
the Captain and his rooms”—across
the small lobby, into the presence of
the sufferer.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class='c022'>Whatever the disposition towards
merriment at his cousin’s expense
entertained by the Squire, it vanished
instantly at the sight of the Captain’s
doleful visage and emaciated
figure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very good in you to come to
town to see me—very good in you,
cousin; and in you too, Mr Dale.
How very well you are both looking.
I’m a sad wreck. You might count
every bone in my body.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hazeldean air and roast beef will
soon set you up, my boy,” said the
Squire kindly. “You were a great
goose to leave them, and these comfortable
rooms of yours in the
Albany.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They <em>are</em> comfortable, though
not showy,” said the Captain, with
tears in his eyes. “I had done my
best to make them so. New carpets—this
very chair—(morocco!)—that
Japan cat (holds toast and muffins)—just
when—just when—(the tears
here broke forth, and the Captain
fairly whimpered)—just when that
ungrateful bad-hearted man wrote me
word ‘he was—was dying and lone
in the world;’ and—and—to think
what I’ve gone through for him!—and
to treat me so. Cousin William,
he has grown as hale as yourself,
and—and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cheer up, cheer up!” cried the
compassionate Squire. “It is a very
hard case, I allow. But you see, as
the old proverb says, ‘’tis ill waiting
for a dead man’s shoes;’ and in
future—I don’t mean offence—but I
think if you would calculate less on
the livers of your relations, it would
be all the better for your own.
Excuse me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cousin William,” replied the poor
Captain, “I am sure I never calculated;
but still, if you had seen that
deceitful man’s good-for-nothing face—as
yellow as a guinea—and have
gone through all I’ve gone through,
you would have felt cut to the heart
as I do. I can’t bear ingratitude. I
never could. But let it pass. Will
that gentleman take a chair?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Parson.</span>—“Mr Fairfield has
kindly called with us, because he
knows something of this system of
homœopathy which you have adopted,
and may, perhaps, know the practitioner.
What is the name of your
doctor?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Captain</span>, (looking at his watch.)—“That
reminds me, (swallowing a
globule.) A great relief these little
pills—after the physic I’ve taken to
please that malignant man. He always
tried his doctor’s stuff upon me.
But there’s another world, and a
juster!”</p>

<p class='c010'>With that pious conclusion, the
Captain again began to weep.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Touched,” muttered the Squire,
with his forefinger on his forehead.
“You seem to have a good tidy sort
of nurse here, Cousin Barnabas. I
hope she’s pleasant, and lively, and
don’t let you take on so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hist!—don’t talk of her. All
mercenary; every bit of her fawning!
Would you believe it? I give
her ten shillings a-week, besides all
that goes down of my pats of butter
and rolls, and I overheard the jade
saying to the laundress that ‘I could
not last long; and she’d—<span class='fss'>EXPECTATIONS</span>!’
Ah, Mr Dale, when one
thinks of the sinfulness there is in
this life! But I’ll not think of it.
No—I’ll not. Let us change the subject.
You were asking my doctor’s
name? It is—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the woman ‘with expectations’
threw open the door, and suddenly
announced—“<span class='sc'>Dr Morgan</span>.”</p>

<h3 class='c020'>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class='c022'>The Parson started, and so did
Leonard.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Homœopathist did not at first
notice either. With an unobservant
bow to the visitors, he went straight to
the patient, and asked, “How go the
symptoms?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Therewith the Captain commenced,
in a tone of voice like a schoolboy
reciting the catalogue of the ships in
Homer. He had been evidently conning
the symptoms, and learning
them by heart. Nor was there a
single nook or corner in his anatomical
organisation, so far as the Captain
was acquainted with that structure,
but what some symptom or other
was dragged therefrom, and exposed
to day. The Squire listened with
horror to the morbific inventory—muttering
at each dread interval,
“Bless me! Lord bless me! What,
more still! Death would be a very
happy release!” Meanwhile the Doctor
endured the recital with exemplary
patience, noting down in the
leaves of his pocket-book what appeared
to him the salient points in
this fortress of disease to which he
had laid siege, and then, drawing
forth a minute paper, said—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Capital—nothing can be better.
This must be dissolved in eight table-spoonfuls
of water; one spoonful
every two hours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Table-spoonful?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Table-spoonful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Nothing can be better,’ did you
say, sir?” repeated the Squire, who,
in his astonishment at that assertion
applied to the Captain’s description
of his sufferings, had hitherto hung
fire—“‘nothing can be better?’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For the diagnosis, sir!” replied
Dr Morgan.</p>

<p class='c010'>“For the dogs’ noses, very possibly,”
quoth the Squire; “but for the
inside of Cousin Higginbotham, I
should think nothing could be
worse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are mistaken, sir,” replied
Dr Morgan. “It is not the Captain
who speaks here—it is his liver.
Liver, sir, though a noble, is an imaginative
organ, and indulges in the
most extraordinary fictions. Seat of
poetry, and love, and jealousy—the
liver. Never believe what it says.
You have no idea what a liar it is!
But—ahem—ahem. Cott—I think
I’ve seen you before, sir. Surely
your name’s Hazeldean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“William Hazeldean, at your service,
Doctor. But where have you
seen me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the hustings at Lansmere.
You were speaking on behalf of your
distinguished brother, Mr Egerton.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hang it!” cried the Squire: “I
think it must have been my liver
that spoke there! for I promised the
electors that that half-brother of mine
would stick by the land; and I never
told a bigger lie in my life!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the patient, reminded of his
other visitors, and afraid he was
going to be bored with the enumeration
of the Squire’s wrongs, and probably
the whole history of his duel
with Captain Dashmore, turned, with
a languid wave of his hand, and said,
“Doctor, another friend of mine, the
Rev. Mr Dale,—and a gentleman who
is acquainted with homœopathy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dale? What, more old friends!”
cried the Doctor, rising; and the
Parson came somewhat reluctantly
from the window nook, to which he
had retired. The Parson and the
Homœopathist shook hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have met before on a very
mournful occasion,” said the Doctor,
with feeling.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Parson held his finger to his
lips, and glanced towards Leonard.
The Doctor stared at the lad, but he
did not recognise in the person before
him the gaunt careworn boy
whom he had placed with Mr Prickett,
until Leonard smiled and spoke. And
the smile and the voice sufficed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cott—and it <em>is</em> the poy!” cried
Dr Morgan; and he actually caught
hold of Leonard, and gave him an
affectionate Welch hug. Indeed, his
agitation at these several surprises
became so great that he stopped
short, drew forth a globule—“Aconite—good
against nervous shocks!”—and
swallowed it incontinently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gad,” said the Squire, rather
astonished, “’tis the first doctor I
ever saw swallow his own medicine!
There must be something in it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain now, highly disgusted
that so much attention was withdrawn
from his own case, asked in a
querulous voice, “And as to diet?
What shall I have for dinner?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A friend!” said the Doctor, wiping
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Zounds!” cried the Squire, retreating,
“do you mean to say,
sir, that the British laws (to be sure,
they are very much changed of late)
allow you to diet your patients upon
their fellow-men? Why, Parson, this
is worse than the donkey sausages.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir,” said Dr Morgan, gravely,
“I mean to say, that it matters little
what we eat, in comparison with care
as to whom we eat with. It is better
to exceed a little with a friend, than
to observe the strictest regimen, and
eat alone. Talk and laughter help
the digestion, and are indispensable
in affections of the liver. I have no
doubt, sir, that it was my patient’s
agreeable society that tended to restore
to health his dyspeptic relative,
Mr Sharpe Currie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain groaned aloud.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And, therefore, if one of you gentlemen
will stay and dine with Mr
Higginbotham, it will greatly assist
the effects of his medicine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain turned an imploring
eye, first towards his cousin, then
towards the Parson.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m engaged to dine with my son—very
sorry,” said the Squire. “But
Dale, here”—</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he will be so kind,” put in the
Captain, “we might cheer the evening
with a game at whist—double
dummy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, poor Mr Dale had set his
heart on dining with an old college
friend, and having, no stupid, prosy
double dummy, in which one cannot
have the pleasure of scolding one’s
partner, but a regular orthodox rubber,
with the pleasing prospect of
scolding all the three other performers.
But as his quiet life forbade
him to be a hero in great things, the
Parson had made up his mind to be
a hero in small ones. Therefore,
though with rather a rueful face, he
accepted the Captain’s invitation, and
promised to return at six o’clock to
dine. Meanwhile, he must hurry off
to the other end of the town, and excuse
himself from the pre-engagement
he had already formed. He now gave
his card, with the address of a quiet
family hotel thereon, to Leonard, and
not looking quite so charmed with
Dr Morgan as he was before that
unwelcome prescription, he took his
leave. The Squire, too, having to see
a new churn, and execute various
commissions for his Harry, went his
way, (not, however, till Dr Morgan
had assured him that, in a few weeks,
the Captain might safely remove to
Hazeldean;) and Leonard was about
to follow, when Morgan hooked his
arm in his old <em>protégé’s</em>, and said,
“But I must have some talk with
you; and you have to tell me all
about the little orphan girl.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Leonard could not resist the pleasure
of talking about Helen; and he
got into the carriage, which was waiting
at the door for the homœopathist.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am going into the country a few
miles to see a patient,” said the Doctor;
“so we shall have time for undisturbed
consultation. I have so
often wondered what had become of
you. Not hearing from Prickett, I
wrote to him, and received an answer
as dry as a bone from his heir. Poor
fellow! I found that he had neglected
his globules, and quitted the globe.
Alas, <i><span lang="la">pulvis et umbra sumus</span></i>! I could
learn no tidings of you. Prickett’s
successor declared he knew nothing
about you. I hoped the best; for I
always fancied you were one who
would fall on your legs—bilious-nervous
temperament; such are the men
who succeed in their undertakings,
especially if they take a spoonful of
<em>chamomilla</em> whenever they are over-excited.
So now for your history and
the little girl’s—pretty little thing—never
saw a more susceptible constitution,
nor one more suited—to pulsatilla.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Leonard briefly related his own
struggles and success, and informed
the good Doctor how they had at last
discovered the nobleman in whom
poor Captain Digby had confided,
and whose care of the orphan had
justified the confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr Morgan opened his eyes at hearing
the name of Lord L’Estrange.
“I remember him very well,” said
he, “when I practised murder as an
allopathist at Lansmere. But to think
that wild boy, so full of whim, and
life, and spirit, should become staid
enough for a guardian to that dear little
child, with her timid eyes and pulsatilla
sensibilities. Well, wonders
never cease. And he has befriended
you too, you say. Ah, he knew your
family.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So he says. Do you think, sir,
that he ever knew—ever saw—my
mother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eh! your mother?—Nora?” exclaimed
the Doctor quickly; and, as
if struck by some sudden thought, his
brows met, and he remained silent
and musing a few moments; then,
observing Leonard’s eyes fixed on
him earnestly, he replied to the question:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“No doubt he saw her; she was
brought up at Lady Lansmere’s. Did
he not tell you so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.” A vague suspicion here
darted through Leonard’s mind, but
as suddenly vanished. His father!
Impossible. His father must have
deliberately wronged the dead mother.
And was Harley L’Estrange
a man capable of such wrong? And
had he been Harley’s son, would not
Harley have guessed it at once, and
so guessing, have owned and claimed
him? Besides, Lord L’Estrange looked
so young;—old enough to be Leonard’s
father!—he could not entertain
the idea. He roused himself, and said
falteringly—</p>

<p class='c010'>“You told me you did not know by
what name I should call my father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I told you the truth, to the
best of my belief.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By your honour, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By my honour, I do not know
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was now a long silence. The
carriage had long left London, and
was on a high-road somewhat lonelier,
and more free from houses than
most of those which form the entrances
to the huge city. Leonard
gazed wistfully from the window, and
the objects that met his eyes gradually
seemed to appeal to his memory.
Yes! it was the road by which he
had first approached the metropolis,
hand in hand with Helen—and hope
so busy at his poet’s heart. He sighed
deeply. He thought he would willingly
have resigned all he had won—independence,
fame, all—to feel again
the clasp of that tender hand—again
to be the sole protector of that gentle
life.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Doctor’s voice broke on his
reverie. “I am going to see a very
interesting patient—coats to his stomach
quite worn out, sir—man of
great learning, with a very inflamed
cerebellum. I can’t do him much
good, and he does me a great deal of
harm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How harm?” asked Leonard,
with an effort at some rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hits me on the heart, and makes
my eyes water—very pathetic case—grand
creature, who has thrown himself
away. Found him given over
by the allopathists, and in a high
state of <em>delirium tremens</em>—restored
him for a time—took a great liking
to him—could not help it—swallowed
a great many globules to harden myself
against him—would not do—brought
him over to England with the
other patients, who all pay me well
(except Captain Higginbotham.)
But this poor fellow pays me nothing—costs
me a great deal in time and
turnpikes, and board and lodging.
Thank Heaven I’m a single man, and
can afford it! My poy, I would let
all the other patients go to the
allopathists if I could but save this
poor big penniless princely fellow.
But what can one do with a stomach
that has not a rag of its coat left?
Stop—(the Doctor pulled the check-string.)
This is the stile. I get out
here and go across the fields.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That stile—those fields—with
what distinctness Leonard remembered
them. Ah, where was Helen? Could
she ever, ever again be his child-angel?</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will go with you, if you permit,”
said he to the good Doctor. “And
while you pay your visit, I will saunter
by a little brook that I think must
run by your way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Brent—you know that brook?
Ah, you should hear my poor patient
talk of it, and of the hours he has
spent angling in it—you would not
know whether to laugh or cry. The
first day he was brought down to the
place, he wanted to go out and try
once more, he said, for his old deluding
demon—a one-eyed perch.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Heavens!” exclaimed Leonard,
“are you speaking of John Burley?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To be sure, that is his name—John
Burley.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, has it come to this? Cure
him, save him, if it be in human
power. For the last two years I have
sought his trace everywhere, and in
vain, the moment I had money of my
own—a home of my own. Poor, erring,
glorious Burley. Take me to him.
Did you say there was no hope?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did not say that,” replied the
Doctor. “But art can only assist
nature; and, though nature is ever at
work to repair the injuries we do to
her, yet, when the coats of a stomach
are all gone, she gets puzzled, and
so do I. You must tell me another
time how you came to know Burley, for
here we are at the house, and I see him
at the window looking out for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Doctor opened the garden gate
to the quiet cottage to which poor
Burley had fled from the pure presence
of Leonard’s child-angel. And
with heavy step, and heavy heart,
Leonard mournfully followed, to behold
the wrecks of him whose wit had
glorified orgy, and “set the table in
a roar.”—Alas, poor Yorick!</p>

<h3 class='c020'>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class='c022'>Audley Egerton stands on his hearth
alone. During the short interval
that has elapsed since we last saw
him, events had occurred memorable
in English history, wherewith we have
nought to do in a narrative studiously
avoiding all party politics even when
treating of politicians. The new
Ministers had stated the general programme
of their policy, and introduced
one measure in especial that
had lifted them at once to the dizzy
height of popular power. But it became
clear that this measure could
not be carried without a fresh appeal
to the people. A dissolution of Parliament,
as Audley’s sagacious experience
had foreseen, was inevitable.
And Audley Egerton had no chance
of return for his own seat—for the
great commercial city identified with
his name. Oh sad, but not rare, instance
of the mutabilities of that same
popular favour now enjoyed by his
successors! The great commoner,
the weighty speaker, the expert man
of business, the statesman who had
seemed a type of the practical steady
sense for which our middle class is
renowned—he who, not three years
since, might have had his honoured
choice of the largest popular constituencies
in the kingdom—he, Audley
Egerton, knew not one single town
(free from the influences of private
property or interest) in which the
obscurest candidate, who bawled out
for the new popular measure, would
not have beaten him hollow. Where
one popular hustings, on which that
grave sonorous voice that had stilled
so often the roar of faction, would not
be drowned amidst the hoots of the
scornful mob?</p>

<p class='c010'>True, what were called the close
boroughs still existed—true, many a
chief of his party would have been
too proud of the honour of claiming
Audley Egerton for his nominee.
But the ex-Minister’s haughty soul
shrunk from this contrast to his
past position. And to fight against
the popular measure, as member of
one of the seats most denounced by
the people,—he felt it was a post
in the grand army of parties below
his dignity to occupy, and foreign
to his peculiar mind, which required
the sense of consequence and station.
And if, in a few months,
these seats were swept away—were
annihilated from the rolls of Parliament—where
was he? Moreover,
Egerton, emancipated from the trammels
that had bound his will while
his party was in office, desired, in the
turn of events, to be nominee of no
other man—desired to stand at least
freely and singly on the ground of his
own services, be guided by his own
penetration; no law for action, but
his strong sense and his stout English
heart. Therefore he had declined
all offers from those who could still
bestow seats in Parliament. Those
he could purchase with hard gold
were yet open to him. And the £5000
he had borrowed from Levy were yet
untouched.</p>

<p class='c010'>To this lone public man, public life,
as we have seen, was the all in all.
But now more than ever it was vital
to his very wants. Around him
yawned ruin. He knew that it was
in Levy’s power at any moment to
foreclose on his mortgaged lands—to
pour in the bonds and the bills which
lay within those rosewood receptacles
that lined the fatal lair of the sleek
usurer—to seize on the very house in
which now moved all the pomp of a
retinue that vied with the <i><span lang="fr">valetaille</span></i> of
dukes—to advertise for public auction,
under execution, “the costly
effects of the Right Hon. Audley
Egerton.” But, consummate in his
knowledge of the world, Egerton felt
assured that Levy would not adopt
these measures against him while he
could still tower in the van of political
war—while he could still see before
him the full chance of restoration to
power, perhaps to power still higher
than before—perhaps to power the
highest of all beneath the throne.
That Levy, whose hate he divined,
though he did not conjecture all its
causes, had hitherto delayed even a
visit, even a menace, seemed to him
to show that Levy still thought him
one “to be helped,” or, at least, one
too powerful to crush. To secure his
position in Parliament unshackled,
unfallen, if but for another year,—new
combinations of party might
arise, new reactions take place, in
public opinion! And, with his hand
pressed to his heart, the stern firm
man muttered,—“If not, I ask but to
die in my harness, and that men may
not know that I am a pauper, until
all that I need from my country is a
grave.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Scarce had these words died upon
his lips ere two quick knocks in succession
resounded at the street door.
In another moment Harley entered,
and, at the same time, the servant
in attendance approached Audley,
and announced Baron Levy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Beg the Baron to wait, unless he
would prefer to name his own hour to
call again,” answered Egerton, with
the slightest possible change of colour.
“You can say I am now with Lord
L’Estrange.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had hoped you had done for
ever with that deluder of youth,”
said Harley, as soon as the groom of
the chambers had withdrawn. “I
remember that you saw too much of
him in the gay time, ere wild oats
are sown; but now surely you can
never need a loan; and if so, is not
Harley L’Estrange by your side?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton.</span>—“My dear Harley!—doubtless
he but comes to talk to me
of some borough. He has much to do
with those delicate negotiations.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Harley.</span>—“And I have come on
the same business. I claim the priority.
I not only hear in the world,
but I see by the papers, that Josiah
Jenkins, Esq., known to fame as an
orator who leaves out his h’s, and
young Lord Willoughby Whiggolin,
who is just now made a Lord of the
Admiralty, because his health is too
delicate for the army, are certain to
come in for the city which you and
your present colleague will as certainly
vacate. That is true, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton.</span>—“My old committee
now vote for Jenkins and Whiggolin.
And I suppose there will not be even
a contest. Go on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So my father and I are agreed
that you must condescend, for the
sake of old friendship, to be once
more member for Lansmere!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Harley,” exclaimed Egerton,
changing countenance far more than
he had done at the announcement of
Levy’s portentous visit—“Harley—No,
no!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! But why? Wherefore such
emotion?” asked L’Estrange, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>Audley was silent.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Harley.</span>—“I suggested the idea to
two or three of the late Ministers;
they all concur in advising you to
accede. In the first place, if declining
to stand for the place which tempted
you from Lansmere, what more natural
than that you should fall back on
that earlier representation? In the
second place, Lansmere is neither a
rotten borough, to be bought, nor a
close borough, under one man’s nomination.
It is a tolerably large constituency.
My father, it is true, has
considerable interest in it, but only
what is called the legitimate influence
of property. At all events, it is more
secure than a contest for a larger
town, more dignified than a seat for a
smaller. Hesitating still? Even my
mother entreats me to say how she
desires you to renew that connection.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Harley,” again exclaimed Egerton;
and, fixing upon his friend’s
earnest face, eyes which, when softened
by emotion, were strangely
beautiful in their expression—“Harley,
if you could but read my heart
at this moment, you would—you
would—” His voice faltered, and he
fairly bent his proud head upon Harley’s
shoulder; grasping the hand he
had caught, nervously, clingingly—“Oh
Harley, if I ever lose your love,
your friendship!—nothing else is left
to me in the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Audley, my dear dear Audley,
is it you who speak to me thus?
You, my school friend, my life’s confidant—you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am grown very weak and foolish,”
said Egerton, trying to smile.
“I do not know myself. I, too, whom
you have so often called ‘Stoic,’ and
likened to the Iron Man in the poem
which you used to read by the riverside
at Eton.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But even then, my Audley, I
knew that a warm human heart (do
what you would to keep it down)
beat strong under the iron ribs. And
I often marvel now, to think you
have gone through life so free from
the wilder passions. Happier so!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Egerton, who had turned his face
from his friend’s gaze, remained silent
for a few moments, and he then
sought to divert the conversation,
and roused himself to ask Harley how
he had succeeded in his views upon
Beatrice, and his watch on the Count.</p>

<p class='c010'>“With regard to Peschiera,” answered
Harley, “I think we must
have overrated the danger we apprehended,
and that his wagers were but
an idle boast. He has remained quiet
enough, and seems devoted to play.
His sister has shut her doors both on
myself and my young associate during
the last few days. I almost fear
that, in spite of very sage warnings of
mine, she must have turned his poet’s
head, and that either he has met with
some scornful rebuff to incautious
admiration, or that he himself has
grown aware of peril, and declines to
face it; for he is very much embarrassed
when I speak to him respecting
her. But if the Count is not
formidable, why, his sister is not
needed; and I hope yet to get justice
for my Italian friend through the
ordinary channels. I have secured an
ally in a young Austrian prince, who
is now in London, and who has promised
to back, with all his influence,
a memorial I shall transmit to Vienna.
<em>Apropos</em>, my dear Audley, now that
you have a little breathing-time, you
must fix an hour for me to present to
you my young poet, the son of <em>her</em>
sister. At moments the expression
of his face is so like hers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ay, ay,” answered Egerton
quickly, “I will see him as you wish,
but later. I have not yet that breathing-time
you speak of; but you say
he has prospered; and, with your
friendship, he is secure from fortune.
I rejoice to think so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And your own <em>protégé</em>, this Randal
Leslie, whom you forbid me to
dislike—hard task!—what has he decided?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To adhere to my fate. Harley, if
it please Heaven that I do not live to return
to power, and provide adequately
for that young man, do not forget that
he clung to me in my fall.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he still cling to you faithfully,
I will never forget it. I will forget
only all that now makes me doubt him.
But you talk of not living, Audley!
Pooh!—your frame is that of a predestined
octogenarian.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nay,” answered Audley, “I was
but uttering one of those vague generalities
which are common upon all
mortal lips. And now farewell—I
must see this Baron.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not yet, until you have promised
to consent to my proposal, and
be once more member for Lansmere.
Tut! don’t shake your head. I cannot
be denied. I claim your promise in
right of our friendship, and shall be
seriously hurt if you even pause to
reflect on it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, well, I know not how to
refuse you, Harley; but you have not
been to Lansmere yourself since—since
that sad event. You must not
revive the old wound—<em>you</em> must not
go; and—and I own it, Harley; the
remembrance of it pains even me. I
would rather not go to Lansmere.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! my friend, this is an excess
of sympathy, and I cannot listen to
it. I begin even to blame my own
weakness, and to feel that we have no
right to make ourselves the soft slaves
of the past.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You do appear to me of late to
have changed,” cried Egerton suddenly,
and with a brightening aspect.
“Do tell me that you are happy in
the contemplation of your new ties—that
I shall live to see you once more
restored to your former self.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All I can answer, Audley,” said
L’Estrange, with a thoughtful brow,
“is, that you are right in one thing—I
am changed; and I am struggling
to gain strength for duty and for honour.
Adieu! I shall tell my father
that you accede to our wishes.”</p>

<h3 class='c020'>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class='c022'>When Harley was gone, Egerton
sunk back on his chair, as if in extreme
physical or mental exhaustion,
all the lines of his countenance relaxed
and jaded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To go back to that place—there—there—where—Courage,
courage—what is another pang?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He rose with an effort, and folding
his arms tightly across his breast,
paced slowly to and fro the large,
mournful, solitary room. Gradually
his countenance assumed its usual
cold and austere composure—the
secret eye, the guarded lip, the
haughty collected front. The man of
the world was himself once more.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now to gain time, and to baffle
the usurer,” murmured Egerton, with
that low tone of easy scorn, which
bespoke consciousness of superior
power and the familiar mastery over
hostile natures. He rang the bell:
the servant entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Baron Levy still waiting?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Admit him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Levy entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I beg your pardon, Levy,” said
the ex-minister, “for having so long
detained you. I am now at your
commands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear fellow,” returned the
Baron, “no apologies between friends
so old as we are; and I fear that my
business is not so agreeable as to
make you impatient to discuss it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton</span>, (with perfect composure.)—“I
am to conclude, then, that you
wish to bring our accounts to a close.
Whenever you will, Levy.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron</span>, (disconcerted and surprised.)—“<i><span lang="fr">Peste!
mon cher</span></i>, you take
things coolly. But if our accounts
are closed, I fear you will have but
little to live upon.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton.</span>—“I can continue to
live on the salary of a Cabinet
Minister.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Baron.</span>—“Possibly; but you are
no longer a Cabinet Minister.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton.</span>—“You have never
found me deceived in a political
prediction. Within twelve months,
(should life be spared to me) I shall
be in office again. If the same to
you, I would rather wait till then,
formally and amicably to resign to
you my lands and this house. If
you grant that reprieve, our connection
can thus close, without the
<em>éclat</em> and noise, which may be invidious
to you, as it would be disagreeable
to me. But if that delay
be inconvenient, I will appoint a
lawyer to examine your accounts, and
adjust my liabilities.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron</span>, (soliloquising.)—“I
don’t like this. A lawyer! That
may be awkward.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton</span>, (observing the Baron,
with a curl of his lip.)—“Well, Levy,
how shall it be?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron.</span>—“You know, my
dear fellow, it is not my character to
be hard on any one, least of all upon
an old friend. And if you really
think there is a chance of your return
to office, which you apprehend that
an <em>esclandre</em> as to your affairs at
present might damage, why, let us see
if we can conciliate matters. But,
first, <i><span lang="fr">mon cher</span></i>, in order to become a
Minister, you must at least have a
seat in Parliament; and, pardon me
the question, how the deuce are you
to find one?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton.</span>—“It is found.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron.</span>—“Ah, I forgot the
£5000 you last borrowed.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton.</span>—“No; I reserve that
sum for another purpose.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron</span>, (with a forced laugh.)—“Perhaps
to defend yourself
against the actions you apprehend
from me?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton.</span>—“You are mistaken.
But to soothe your suspicions, I will
tell you plainly, that finding any
sum I might have insured on my life
would be liable to debts preincurred,
and (as you will be my sole creditor)
might thus at my death pass back to
you; and doubting whether, indeed,
any office would accept my insurance,
I appropriate that sum to the relief
of my conscience. I intend to bestow
it, while yet in life, upon my late
wife’s kinsman, Randal Leslie. And
it is solely the wish to do what I
consider an act of justice, that has
prevailed with me to accept a favour
from the hands of Harley L’Estrange,
and to become again the member for
Lansmere.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron.</span>—“Ha!—Lansmere!
You will stand for Lansmere?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton</span>, (wincing.)—“I propose
to do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron.</span>—“I believe you will
be opposed, subjected to even a sharp
contest. Perhaps you may lose
your election.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton.</span>—“If so, I resign myself,
and you can foreclose on my estates.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron</span>, (his brow colouring.)—“Look
you, Egerton, I shall be
too happy to do you a favour.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton</span>, (with stateliness.)—“Favour!
No, Baron Levy, I ask
from you no favour. Dismiss all
thought of rendering me one. It is
but a consideration of business on
both sides. If you think it better
that we shall at once settle our
accounts, my lawyer shall investigate
them. If you agree to the delay I
request, my lawyer shall give you no
trouble; and all that I have, except
hope and character, pass to your
hands without a struggle.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron.</span>—“Inflexible and
ungracious, favour or not—put it as
you will—I accede, provided, first,
that you allow me to draw up a
fresh deed, which will accomplish
your part of the compact;—and
secondly, that we saddle the proposed
delay with the condition that you do
not lose your election.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton.</span>—“Agreed. Have you
anything further to say?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron.</span>—“Nothing, except
that, if you require more money, I am
still at your service.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton.</span>—“I thank you. No;
I owe no man aught except yourself.
I shall take the occasion of my retirement
from office to reduce my establishment.
I have calculated already,
and provided for the expenditure I
need, up to the date I have specified,
and I shall have no occasion to touch
the £5000 that I still retain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your young friend, Mr Leslie,
ought to be very grateful to you,”
said the Baron, rising. “I have met
him in the world—a lad of much promise
and talent. You should try and
get him also into Parliament.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton</span>, (thoughtfully.)—“You
are a good judge of the practical
abilities and merits of men, as regards
worldly success. Do you really think
Randal Leslie calculated for public life—for
a Parliamentary career?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron.</span>—“Indeed I do.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton</span>, (speaking more to himself
than Levy.)—“Parliament without
fortune—’tis a sharp trial; still
he is prudent, abstemious, energetic,
persevering; and at the onset, under
my auspices and advice, he might
establish a position beyond his
years.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron.</span>—“It strikes me that
we might possibly get him into the
next Parliament; or, as that is not
likely to last long, at all events into
the Parliament to follow—not for one
of the boroughs which will be swept
away, but for a permanent seat, and
without expense.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Egerton.</span>—“Ay—and how?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Baron.</span>—“Give me a few days
to consider. An idea has occurred to
me. I will call again if I find it practicable.
Good day to you, Egerton,
and success to your election for Lansmere.”</p>

<h3 class='c020'>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class='c022'>Peschiera had not been so inactive
as he had appeared to Harley
and the reader. On the contrary, he
had prepared the way for his ultimate
design, with all the craft and the unscrupulous
resolution which belonged
to his nature. His object was to
compel Riccabocca into assenting to
the Count’s marriage with Violante,
or, failing that, to ruin all chance of
his kinsman’s restoration. Quietly
and secretly he had sought out,
amongst the most needy and unprincipled
of his own countrymen, those
whom he could suborn to depose to
Riccabocca’s participation in plots and
conspiracies against the Austrian dominions.
These his former connection
with the Carbonari enabled
him to track in their refuge in London;
and his knowledge of the characters
he had to deal with fitted him well
for the villanous task he undertook.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had, therefore, already collected
witnesses sufficient for his purposes,
making up in number for their defects
in quality. Meanwhile, he had (as
Harley had suspected he would) set
spies upon Randal’s movements; and
the day before that young traitor confided
to him Violante’s retreat, he had,
at least, got scent of her father’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>The discovery that Violante was
under a roof so honoured, and seemingly
so safe as Lord Lansmere’s, did
not discourage this bold and desperate
adventurer. We have seen him set
forth to reconnoitre the house at
Knightsbridge. He had examined it
well, and discovered the quarter which
he judged favourable to a <em>coup-de-main</em>,
should that become necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lord Lansmere’s house and grounds
were surrounded by a wall, the entrance
being to the high-road, and by
a porter’s lodge. At the rear there lay
fields crossed by a lane or by-road.
To these fields a small door in the wall,
which was used by the gardeners in
passing to and from their work, gave
communication. This door was usually
kept locked; but the lock was of the
rude and simple description common
to such entrances, and easily opened
by a skeleton key. So far there was
no obstacle which Peschiera’s experience
in conspiracy and gallantry did
not disdain as trivial. But the Count
was not disposed to abrupt and violent
means in the first instance. He had
a confidence in his personal gifts, in
his address, in his previous triumphs
over the sex, which made him naturally
desire to hazard the effect of a
personal interview; and on this he
resolved with his wonted audacity.
Randal’s description of Violante’s
personal appearance, and such suggestions
as to her character and the
motives most likely to influence her
actions, as that young lynx-eyed
observer could bestow, were all that
the Count required of present aid
from his accomplice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile we return to Violante
herself. We see her now seated in
the gardens at Knightsbridge, side by
side with Helen. The place was retired,
and out of sight from the windows
of the house.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Violante.</span>—“But why will you
not tell me more of that early time?
You are less communicative even
than Leonard.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Helen</span>, (looking down, and hesitatingly.)—“Indeed
there is nothing to
tell you that you do not know; and it
is so long since, and things are so
changed now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The tone of the last words was
mournful, and the words ended with
a sigh.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Violante</span>, (with enthusiasm.)—“How
I envy you that past which
you treat so lightly! To have been
something, even in childhood, to the
formation of a noble nature; to have
borne on those slight shoulders half
the load of a man’s grand labour.
And now to see Genius moving calm
in its clear career; and to say inly,
‘Of that genius I am a part!’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Helen</span>, (sadly and humbly.)—“A
part! Oh, no! A part? I don’t
understand you.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Violante.</span>—“Take the child Beatrice
from Dante’s life, and should
we have a Dante? What is a poet’s
genius but the voice of its emotions?
All things in life and in Nature influence
genius; but what influences
it the most, are its sorrows and
affections.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Helen looks softly into Violante’s
eloquent face, and draws nearer to
her in tender silence.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Violante</span>, (suddenly.)—“Yes,
Helen, yes—I know by my own heart
how to read yours. Such memories
are ineffaceable. Few guess what
strange self-weavers of our own
destinies we women are in our veriest
childhood!” She sunk her voice into
a whisper: “How could Leonard
fail to be dear to you—dear as you
to him—dearer than all others?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Helen</span>, (shrinking back, and greatly
disturbed.)—“Hush, hush! you
must not speak to me thus; it is
wicked—I cannot bear it. I would
not have it be so—it must not be—it
cannot!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She clasped her hands over her
eyes for a moment, and then lifted
her face, and the face was very sad,
but very calm.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Violante</span>, (twining her arm round
Helen’s waist.)—“How have I
wounded you?—how offended? Forgive
me—but why is this wicked?
Why must it not be? Is it because
he is below you in birth?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Helen.</span>—“No, no—I never thought
of that. And what am I? Don’t
ask me—I cannot answer. You are
wrong, quite wrong, as to me. I can
only look on Leonard as—as a brother.
But—but, you can speak to him more
freely than I can. I would not have
him waste his heart on me, nor yet
think me unkind and distant, as I
seem. I know not what I say. But—but—break
to him—indirectly—gently—that
duty in both forbids us
both to—to be more than friends—than——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Helen, Helen!” cried Violante,
in her warm, generous passion,
“your heart betrays you in every
word you say. You weep; lean on
me, whisper to me; why—why is
this? Do you fear that your guardian
would not consent? He not consent!
He who—”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Helen.</span>—“Cease—cease—cease.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Violante.</span>—“What! You can fear
Harley—Lord L’Estrange? Fie;
you do not know him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Helen</span>, (rising suddenly.)—“Violante,
hold; I am engaged to another.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Violante rose also, and stood still,
as if turned to stone; pale as death,
till the blood came, at first slowly,
then with suddenness from her
heart, and one deep glow suffused
her whole countenance. She caught
Helen’s hand firmly, and said, in a
hollow voice—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Another! Engaged to another!
One word, Helen—not to him—not to—Harley—to——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot say—I must not. I have
promised,” cried poor Helen, and as
Violante let fall her hand, she hurried
away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Violante sate down, mechanically.
She felt as if stunned by a mortal
blow. She closed her eyes, and
breathed hard. A deadly faintness
seized her; and when it passed away,
it seemed to her as if she were no
longer the same being, nor the world
around her the same world—as if she
were but one sense of intense, hopeless
misery, and as if the universe
were but one inanimate void. So
strangely immaterial are we really—we
human beings, with flesh and
blood—that if you suddenly abstract
from us but a single, impalpable,
airy thought, which our souls have
cherished, you seem to curdle the
air, to extinguish the sun, to snap
every link that connects us to matter,
and to benumb everything into death,
except woe.</p>

<p class='c010'>And this warm, young, southern
nature, but a moment before was so
full of joy and life, and vigorous, lofty
hope. It never till now had known
its own intensity and depth. The virgin
had never lifted the veil from her
own soul of woman. What, till then,
had Harley L’Estrange been to Violante?
An ideal—a dream of some
imagined excellence—a type of poetry
in the midst of the common world.
It had not been Harley the Man—it
had been Harley the Phantom. She
had never said to herself, “He is
identified with my love, my hopes,
my home, my future.” How could
she? Of such, he himself had never
spoken; an internal voice, indeed,
had vaguely, yet irresistibly, whispered
to her that, despite his light
words, his feelings towards her were
grave and deep. O false voice! how
it had deceived her. Her quick convictions
seized the all that Helen had
left unsaid. And now suddenly she
felt what it is to love, and what it is
to despair. So she sate, crushed
and solitary, neither murmuring nor
weeping, only now and then passing
her hand across her brow, as if to clear
away some cloud that would not be
dispersed; or heaving a deep sigh, as
if to throw off some load that no time
henceforth could remove. There are
certain moments in life in which we
say to ourselves, “All is over; no
matter what else changes, that which
I have made my all is gone evermore—evermore.”
And our own thought
rings back in our ears, “Evermore—evermore!”</p>

<h3 class='c020'>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class='c022'>As Violante thus sate, a stranger,
passing stealthily through the trees,
stood between herself and the evening
sun. She saw him not. He
paused a moment, and then spoke
low, in her native tongue, addressing
her by the name which she had borne
in Italy. He spoke as a relation, and
excused his intrusion: “For,” said he,
“I come to suggest to the daughter the
means by which she can restore to her
father his country and his honours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At the word “father” Violante
roused herself, and all her love for
that father rushed back upon her
with double force. It does so ever—we
love most our parents at the
moment when some tie less holy is
abruptly broken; and when the conscience
says, “<em>There</em>, at least, is a
love that never has deceived thee!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She saw before her a man of mild
aspect and princely form. Peschiera
(for it was he) had banished from his
dress, as from his countenance, all
that betrayed the worldly levity of
his character. He was acting a part,
and he dressed and looked it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My father!” she said quickly,
and in Italian. “What of him? And
who are you, signior? I know you not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Peschiera smiled benignly, and replied
in a tone in which great respect
was softened by a kind of parental
tenderness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suffer me to explain, and listen
to me while I speak.” Then, quietly
seating himself on the bench beside
her, he looked into her eyes, and resumed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Doubtless, you have heard of the
Count di Peschiera?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Violante.</span>—“I heard that name,
as a child, when in Italy. And when
she with whom I then dwelt, (my
father’s aunt,) fell ill and died, I was
told that my home in Italy was gone,
that it had passed to the Count di
Peschiera—my father’s foe.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Peschiera.</span>—“And your father,
since then, has taught you to hate
this fancied foe?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Violante.</span>—“Nay; my father did
but forbid me ever to breathe his
name.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Peschiera.</span>—“Alas! what years
of suffering and exile might have been
saved your father, had he but been
more just to his early friend and kinsman;
nay, had he but less cruelly
concealed the secret of his retreat.
Fair child, I am that Giulio Franzini,
that Count di Peschiera. I am the
man you have been told to regard as
your father’s foe. I am the man on
whom the Austrian emperor bestowed
his lands. And now judge if I am in
truth the foe. I have come hither to
seek your father, in order to dispossess
myself of my sovereign’s gift.
I have come but with one desire, to
restore Alphonso to his native land,
and to surrender the heritage that
was forced upon me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Violante.</span>—“My father, my dear
father! His grand heart will have
room once more. Oh! this is noble
enmity, true revenge. I understand
it, signior, and so will my father, for
such would have been his revenge on
you. You have seen him?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Peschiera.</span>—“No, not yet. I
would not see him till I had seen
yourself; for you, in truth, are the
arbiter of his destinies, as of mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Violante.</span>—“I—Count? I—arbiter
of my father’s destinies? Is it
possible!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Peschiera</span>, (with a look of compassionate
admiration, and in a tone
yet more emphatically parental.)—How
lovely is that innocent joy;
but do not indulge it yet. Perhaps it
is a sacrifice which is asked from you—a
sacrifice too hard to bear. Do
not interrupt me. Listen still, and you
will see why I could not speak to your
father until I had obtained an interview
with yourself. See why a word
from you may continue still to banish
me from his presence. You know,
doubtless, that your father was one
of the chiefs of a party that sought to
free Northern Italy from the Austrians.
I myself was at the onset a warm
participator in that scheme. In a
sudden moment I discovered that
some of its more active projectors had
coupled with a patriotic enterprise
schemes of a dark nature—and that
the conspiracy itself was about to be
betrayed to the government. I wished
to consult with your father; but he
was at a distance. I learned that his
life was condemned. Not an hour was
to be lost. I took a bold resolve, that
has exposed me to his suspicions, and
to my country’s wrath. But my main
idea was to save him, my early friend,
from death, and my country from
fruitless massacre. I withdrew from
the intended revolt. I sought at once
the head of the Austrian government
in Italy, and made terms for the lives
of Alphonso and of the other more illustrious
chiefs, which otherwise would
have been forfeited. I obtained permission
to undertake myself the charge
of securing my kinsman in order to
place him in safety, and to conduct
him to a foreign land, in an exile that
would cease when the danger was
dispelled. But unhappily he deemed
that I only sought to destroy him.
He fled from my friendly pursuit.
The soldiers with me were attacked
by an intermeddling Englishman; your
father escaped from Italy—concealing
his retreat; and the character of his
flight counteracted my efforts to
obtain his pardon. The government
conferred on me half his revenues,
holding the other at its pleasure. I
accepted the offer to save his whole
heritage from confiscation. That I
did not convey to him, what I pined
to do—viz., the information that I held
but in trust what was bestowed by
the government, and the full explanation
of what seemed blamable in my
conduct—was necessarily owing to the
secresy he maintained. I could not
discover his refuge; but I never
ceased to plead for his recall. This
year only I have partially succeeded.
He can be restored to his heritage and
rank, on one proviso—a guarantee for
his loyalty. That guarantee the government
has named: it is the alliance
of his only child with one whom the
government can trust. It was the
interest of all Italian nobility, that
the representation of a house so great
falling to a female, should not pass
away wholly from the direct line;—in
a word, that you should ally yourself
with a kinsman. But one kinsman,
and he the next in blood, presented
himself. Brief—Alphonso regains all
that he lost on the day in which his
daughter gives her hand to Giulio
Franzini, Count di Peschiera. “Ah,”
continued the Count, mournfully,
“you shrink—you recoil. He thus
submitted to your choice is indeed
unworthy of you. You are scarce in
the spring of life. He is in its waning
autumn. Youth loves youth. He
does not aspire to your love. All that
he can say is, love is not the only joy
of the heart—it is joy to raise from
ruin a beloved father—joy to restore,
to a land poor in all but memories,
a chief in whom it reverences a line
of heroes. These are the joys I offer
to you—you, a daughter, and an
Italian maid. Still silent! Oh speak
to me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Certainly this Count Peschiera
knew well how woman is to be wooed
and won; and never was woman more
sensitive to those high appeals which
most move all true earnest womanhood,
than was the young Violante.
Fortune favoured him in the moment
chosen. Harley was wrenched away
from her hopes, and love a word
erased from her language. In the
void of the world, her father’s image
alone stood clear and visible. And
she who from infancy had so pined to
serve that father, who had first
learned to dream of Harley as that
father’s friend! She could restore to
him all for which the exile sighed;
and by a sacrifice of self! Self-sacrifice,
ever in itself such a temptation to
the noble! Still, in the midst of the
confusion and disturbance of her
mind, the idea of marriage with
another seemed so terrible and revolting,
that she could not at once conceive
it; and still that instinct of openness
and honour, which pervaded all her
character, warned even her inexperience
that there was something wrong
in this clandestine appeal to herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again the Count besought her to
speak; and with an effort she said,
irresolutely—</p>

<p class='c010'>“If it be as you say, it is not for me
to answer you; it is for my father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nay,” replied Peschiera. “Pardon,
if I contradict you. Do you
know so little of your father as to
suppose that he will suffer his interest
to dictate to his pride. He would
refuse, perhaps, even to receive my
visit—to hear my explanations; but
certainly he would refuse to buy
back his inheritance by the sacrifice
of his daughter to one whom he has
deemed his foe, and whom the mere
disparity of years would incline the
world to say he had made the barter of
his personal ambition. But if I could
go to him sanctioned by you—if I could
say your daughter overlooks what the
father might deem an obstacle—she
has consented to accept my hand of her
own free choice—she unites her happiness,
and blends her prayers, with
mine,—then, indeed, I could not fail
of success: and Italy would pardon
my errors, and bless your name. Ah!
Signorina, do not think of me save as
an instrument towards the fulfilment
of duties so high and sacred—think
but of your ancestors, your father,
your native land, and reject not the
proud occasion to prove how you
revere them all!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Violante’s heart was touched at the
right chord. Her head rose—her
colour came back to her pale cheek—she
turned the glorious beauty of
her countenance towards the wily
tempter. She was about to answer,
and to seal her fate, when at that
instant Harley’s voice was heard at a
little distance, and Nero came bounding
towards her, and thrust himself,
with rough familiarity, between herself
and Peschiera. The Count drew
back, and Violante, whose eyes were
still fixed on his face, started at the
change that passed there. One quick
gleam of rage sufficed in an instant
to light up the sinister secrets of his
nature—it was the face of the baffled
gladiator. He had time but for few
words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must not be seen here,” he
muttered; “but to-morrow—in these
gardens—about this hour. I implore
you, for the sake of your father—his
hopes, fortunes, his very life, to guard
the secret of this interview—to meet
me again. Adieu!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He vanished amidst the trees, and
was gone—noiselessly, mysteriously,
as he had come.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class='c022'>The last words of Peschiera were
still ringing in Violante’s ears when
Harley appeared in sight, and the
sound of his voice dispelled the vague
and dreamy stupor which had crept
over her senses. At that voice there
returned the consciousness of a mighty
loss, the sting of an intolerable anguish.
To meet Harley there, and
thus, seemed impossible. She turned
abruptly away, and hurried towards
the house. Harley called to her by
name, but she would not answer, and
only quickened her steps. He paused
a moment in surprise, and then
hastened after her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Under what strange taboo am I
placed?” said he gaily, as he laid
his hand on her shrinking arm. “I
inquire for Helen—she is ill, and cannot
see me. I come to sun myself
in your presence, and you fly me as
if gods and men had set their mark
on my brow. Child!—child!—what
is this? You are weeping?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not stay me now—do not
speak to me,” answered Violante
through her stifling sobs, as she broke
from his hand and made towards the
house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you a grief, and under the
shelter of my father’s roof? A grief
that you will not tell to me? Cruel!”
cried Harley, with inexpressible
tenderness of reproach in his soft
tones.</p>

<p class='c010'>Violante could not trust herself to
reply. Ashamed of her self-betrayal—softened
yet more by his pleading
voice—she could have prayed to the
earth to swallow her. At length,
checking back her tears by a heroic
effort, she said, almost calmly, “Noble
friend, forgive me. I have no grief,
believe me, which—which I can tell
to you. I was but thinking of my poor
father when you came up; alarming
myself about him, it may be, with
vain superstitious fears; and so—even
a slight surprise—your abrupt appearance,
has sufficed to make me thus
weak and foolish; but I wish to see
my father!—to go home—home!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your father is well, believe me,
and pleased that you are here. No
danger threatens him; and you, <em>here</em>,
are safe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I safe—and from what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Harley mused irresolute. He inclined
to confide to her the danger
which her father had concealed; but
had he the right to do so against her
father’s will?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give me,” he said, “time to reflect,
and to obtain permission to
intrust you with a secret which, in my
judgment, you should know. Meanwhile,
this much I may say, that
rather than you should incur the
danger that I believe he exaggerates,
your father would have given you a
protector—even in Randal Leslie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Violante started.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But,” resumed Harley, with a
calm, in which a certain deep mournfulness
was apparent, unconsciously to
himself—“but I trust you are reserved
for a fairer fate, and a nobler
spouse. I have vowed to live henceforth
in the common workday world.
But for you, bright child, for you, I
am a dreamer still!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Violante turned her eyes for one
instant towards the melancholy
speaker. The look thrilled to his
heart. He bowed his face involuntarily.
When he looked up, she had left his
side. He did not this time attempt
to follow her, but moved away and
plunged amidst the leafless trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>An hour afterwards he re-entered
the house, and again sought to see
Helen. She had now recovered sufficiently
to give him the interview he
requested.</p>

<p class='c010'>He approached her with a grave
and serious gentleness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear Helen,” said he, “you
have consented to be my wife, my
life’s mild companion; let it be soon—soon—for
I need you. I need all
the strength of that holy tie. Helen,
let me press you to fix the time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I owe you too much,” answered
Helen, looking down, “to have a will
but yours. But your mother,” she
added, perhaps clinging to the idea
of some reprieve—“your mother has
not yet—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother—true. I will speak
first to her. You shall receive from
my family all honour due to your
gentle virtues. Helen, by the way,
have you mentioned to Violante the
bond between us?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No—that is, I fear I may have
unguardedly betrayed it, against Lady
Lansmere’s commands too—but—but—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So, Lady Lansmere forbade you
to name it to Violante. This should
not be. I will answer for her permission
to revoke that interdict. It is
due to Violante and to you. Tell
your young friend all. Ah, Helen,
if I am at times cold or wayward,
bear with me—bear with me; for
you love me, do you not?”</p>

<h3 class='c020'>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class='c022'>That same evening Randal heard
from Levy (at whose house he staid
late) of that self-introduction to Violante
which (thanks to his skeleton key)
Peschiera had contrived to effect;
and the Count seemed more than
sanguine—he seemed assured as to
the full and speedy success of his
matrimonial enterprise. “Therefore,”
said Levy, “I trust I may very
soon congratulate you on the acquisition
of your family estates.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Strange!” answered Randal,
“strange that my fortunes seem so
bound up with the fate of a foreigner
like Beatrice di Negra and her connection
with Frank Hazeldean.” He
looked up at the clock as he spoke,
and added—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Frank, by this time, has told his
father of his engagement.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you feel sure that the Squire
cannot be coaxed into consent?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; but I feel sure that the
Squire will be so choleric at the first
intelligence, that Frank will not have
the self-control necessary for coaxing;
and, perhaps, before the Squire can
relent upon this point, he may, by
some accident, learn his grievances
on another, which would exasperate
him still more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ay, I understand—the <em>post obit</em>?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randal nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what then?” asked Levy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The next of kin to the lands of
Hazeldean may have his day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Baron smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have good prospects in that
direction, Leslie: look now to another.
I spoke to you of the borough of
Lansmere. Your patron, Audley
Egerton, intends to stand for it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randal’s heart had of late been so
set upon other and more avaricious
schemes, that a seat in Parliament
had sunk into a secondary object;
nevertheless, his ambitious and all-grasping
nature felt a bitter pang,
when he heard that Egerton thus
interposed between himself and any
chance of advancement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So!” he muttered sullenly—“so.
This man, who pretends to be my
benefactor, squanders away the wealth
of my forefathers—throws me penniless
on the world; and, while still
encouraging me to exertion and public
life, robs me himself of—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No!” interrupted Levy—“not
robs you; we may prevent that.
The Lansmere interest is not so strong
in the borough as Dick Avenel’s.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I cannot stand against Egerton.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Assuredly not—you may stand
with him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dick Avenel will never suffer
Egerton to come in; and though he
cannot, perhaps, carry two of his own
politics, he can split his votes upon
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randal’s eyes flashed. He saw at
a glance, that if Avenel did not overrate
the relative strength of parties,
his seat could be secured.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But,” he said, “Egerton has not
spoken to me on such a subject; nor
can you expect that he would propose
to me to stand with him, if he foresaw
the chance of being ousted by
the very candidate he himself introduced.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Neither he nor his party will
anticipate that possibility. If he asks
you, agree to stand—leave the rest
to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must hate Egerton bitterly,”
said Randal; “for I am not vain
enough to think that you thus scheme
but from pure love to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The motives of men are intricate
and complicated,” answered Levy,
with unusual seriousness. “It suffices
to the wise to profit by the actions,
and leave the motives in shade.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was silence for some minutes.
Then the two drew closer towards
each other, and began to discuss details
in their joint designs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randal walked home slowly. It
was a cold moonlit night. Young
idlers of his own years and rank
passed him by, on their way from the
haunts of social pleasure. They were
yet in the first fair holiday of life.
Life’s holiday had gone from him for
ever. Graver men, in the various
callings of masculine labour—professions,
trade, the state—passed him
also. Their steps might be sober,
and their faces careworn; but no
step had the furtive stealth of his—no
face the same contracted, sinister,
suspicious gloom. Only once, in a
lonely thoroughfare, and on the opposite
side of the way, fell a foot-fall,
and glanced an eye, that seemed to
betray a soul in sympathy with Randal
Leslie’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Randal, who had heeded none
of the other passengers by the way,
as if instinctively, took note of this
one. His nerves crisped at the noiseless
slide of that form, as it stalked
on from lamp to lamp, keeping pace
with his own. He felt a sort of awe,
as if he had beheld the wraith of himself;
and ever, as he glanced suspiciously
at the stranger, the stranger
glanced at him. He was inexpressibly
relieved when the figure turned down
another street and vanished.</p>

<p class='c010'>That man was a felon, as yet undetected.
Between him and his kind
there stood but a thought—a veil airspun,
but impassable, as the veil of
the Image at Sais.</p>

<p class='c010'>And thus moved and thus looked
Randal Leslie, a thing of dark and
secret mischief—within the pale of the
law, but equally removed from man
by the vague consciousness that at
his heart lay that which the eyes of
man would abhor and loathe. Solitary
amidst the vast city, and on
through the machinery of Civilisation,
went the still spirit of Intellectual
Evil.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class='c022'>Early the next morning Randal
received two notes—one from Frank,
written in great agitation, begging
Randal to see and propitiate his father,
whom he feared he had grievously
offended; and then running off, rather
incoherently, into protestations that
his honour as well as his affections
were engaged irrevocably to Beatrice,
and that her, at least, he could never
abandon.</p>

<p class='c010'>And the second note was from the
Squire himself—short, and far less
cordial than usual—requesting Mr
Leslie to call on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randal dressed in haste, and went
at once to Limmer’s hotel.</p>

<p class='c010'>He found the Parson with Mr
Hazeldean, and endeavouring in vain
to soothe him. The Squire had not
slept all night, and his appearance
was almost haggard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oho! Mr young Leslie,” said he,
throwing himself back in his chair as
Randal entered—“I thought you
were a friend—I thought you were
Frank’s adviser. Explain, sir; explain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gently, my dear Mr Hazeldean,”
said the Parson. “You do but surprise
and alarm Mr Leslie. Tell him more
distinctly what he has to explain.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Squire.</span>—“Did you or did you
not tell me or Mrs Hazeldean, that
Frank was in love with Violante
Rickeybockey?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Randal</span>, (as in amaze.)—“I!
Never, sir! I feared, on the contrary,
that he was somewhat enamoured
of a very different person. I
hinted at that possibility. I could
not do more, for I did not know how
far Frank’s affections were seriously
engaged. And indeed, sir, Mrs Hazeldean,
though not encouraging the
idea that your son could marry a
foreigner and a Roman Catholic, did
not appear to consider such objections
insuperable, if Frank’s happiness were
really at stake.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the poor Squire gave way to
a burst of passion, that involved, in
one tempest, Frank, Randal, Harry
herself, and the whole race of
foreigners, Roman Catholics, and
women. While the Squire himself was
still incapable of hearing reason, the
Parson, taking aside Randal, convinced
himself that the whole affair,
so far as Randal was concerned, had
its origin in a very natural mistake;
and that while that young gentleman
had been hinting at Beatrice, Mrs
Hazeldean had been thinking of
Violante. With considerable difficulty
he succeeded in conveying this
explanation to the Squire, and somewhat
appeasing his wrath against
Randal. And the Dissimulator, seizing
his occasion, then expressed so
much grief and astonishment at learning
that matters had gone as far
as the Parson informed him—that
Frank had actually proposed to Beatrice,
been accepted, and engaged
himself, before even communicating
with his father; he declared so
earnestly, that he could never conjecture
such evil—that he had had
Frank’s positive promise to take no
step without the sanction of his
parents; he professed such sympathy
with the Squire’s wounded feelings,
and such regret at Frank’s involvement,
that Mr Hazeldean at last
yielded up his honest heart to his
consoler—and griping Randal’s hand,
said, “Well, well, I wronged you—beg
your pardon. What now is to be
done?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, you cannot consent to this
marriage—impossible,” replied Randal;
“and we must hope therefore to
influence Frank by his sense of duty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s it,” said the Squire; “for
I’ll not give way. Pretty pass things
have come to, indeed! A widow too, I
hear. Artful jade—thought, no doubt,
to catch a Hazeldean of Hazeldean.
My estates go to an outlandish Papistical
set of mongrel brats! No, no,
never!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But,” said the Parson, mildly,
“perhaps we may be unjustly prejudiced
against this lady. We should
have consented to Violante—why not
to her? She is of good family?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly,” said Randal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And good character?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randal shook his head, and sighed.
The Squire caught him roughly by
the arm—“Answer the Parson!”
cried he, vehemently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed, sir, I cannot speak ill of
the character of a woman, who may,
too, be Frank’s wife; and the world
is ill-natured, and not to be believed.
But you can judge for yourself, my
dear Mr Hazeldean. Ask your brother
whether Madame di Negra is one
whom he would advise his nephew to
marry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My brother!” exclaimed the Squire
furiously. “Consult my distant
brother on the affairs of my own son!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is a man of the world,” put
in Randal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And of feeling and honour,” said
the Parson; “and, perhaps, through
him, we may be enabled to enlighten
Frank, and save him from what
appears to be the snare of an artful
woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Meanwhile,” said Randal, “I
will seek Frank, and do my best with
him. Let me go now—I will return
in an hour or so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will accompany you,” said the
Parson.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nay, pardon me, but I think we
two young men can talk more openly
without a third person, even so wise
and kind as you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let Randal go,” growled the
Squire. And Randal went.</p>

<p class='c010'>He spent some time with Frank,
and the reader will easily divine how
that time was employed. As he left
Frank’s lodgings, he found himself
suddenly seized by the Squire himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was too impatient to stay at
home and listen to the Parson’s
prosing,” said Mr Hazeldean, nervously.
“I have shaken Dale off.
Tell me what has passed. Oh! don’t
fear—I’m a man, and can bear the
worst.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randal drew the Squire’s arm
within his, and led him into the
adjacent park.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear sir,” said he, sorrowfully,
“this is very confidential what
I am about to say. I must repeat it
to you, because without such confidence,
I see not how to advise you
on the proper course to take. But if
I betray Frank, it is for his good, and
to his own father;—only do not tell
him. He would never forgive me—it
would for ever destroy my influence
over him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go on, go on,” gasped the Squire;
“speak out. I’ll never tell the ungrateful
boy that I learned his secrets
from another.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then,” said Randal, “the secret
of his entanglement with Madame di
Negra is simply this—he found her
in debt—nay, on the point of being
arrested—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Debt!—arrested! Jezabel!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And in paying the debt himself,
and saving her from arrest, he conferred
on her the obligation which no
woman of honour could accept save
from her affianced husband. Poor
Frank!—if sadly taken in, still we
must pity and forgive him!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly, to Randal’s great surprise,
the Squire’s whole face brightened
up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see, I see!” he exclaimed, slapping
his thigh. “I have it—I have
it. ’Tis an affair of money! I can
buy her off. If she took money from
him, the mercenary, painted baggage!
why, then, she’ll take it from me. I
don’t care what it costs—half my fortune—all!
I’d be content never to
see Hazeldean Hall again, if I could
save my son, my own son, from disgrace
and misery; for miserable he
will be, when he knows he has
broken my heart and his mother’s.
And for a creature like that! My
boy, a thousand hearty thanks to you.
Where does the wretch live? I’ll go
to her at once.” And as he spoke,
the Squire actually pulled out his
pocket-book and began turning over
and counting the bank-notes in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randal at first tried to combat this
bold resolution on the part of the
Squire; but Mr Hazeldean had seized
on it with all the obstinacy of his
straightforward English mind. He
cut Randal’s persuasive eloquence off
in the midst.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t waste your breath. I’ve
settled it; and if you don’t tell me
where she lives, ’tis easily found out,
I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randal mused a moment. “After
all,” thought he, “why not? He will
be sure so to speak as to enlist her
pride against himself, and to irritate
Frank to the utmost. Let him go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Accordingly, he gave the information
required; and, insisting with great
earnestness on the Squire’s promise
not to mention to Madame di Negra
his knowledge of Frank’s pecuniary
aid, (for that would betray Randal
as the informant); and satisfying
himself as he best might with the
Squire’s prompt assurance, “that he
knew how to settle matters, without
saying why or wherefore, as long as
he opened his purse wide enough,” he
accompanied Mr Hazeldean back into
the streets, and there left him—fixing
an hour in the evening for an interview
at Limmer’s, and hinting that
it would be best to have that interview
without the presence of the
Parson. “Excellent good man,”
said Randal, “but not with sufficient
knowledge of the world for affairs
of this kind, which <em>you</em> understand so
well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should think so,” quoth the
Squire, who had quite recovered his
good-humour. “And the Parson is
as soft as buttermilk. We must be
firm here—firm, sir.” And the Squire
struck the end of his stick on the
pavement, nodded to Randal, and
went on to Mayfair as sturdily and
as confidently as if to purchase a
prize cow at a cattle show.</p>

<h3 class='c020'>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class='c022'>“Bring the light nearer,” said
John Burley—“nearer still.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Leonard obeyed, and placed the
candle on a little table by the sick
man’s bedside.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burley’s mind was partially wandering;
but there was method in his
madness. Horace Walpole said that
“his stomach would survive all the
rest of him.” That which in Burley
survived the last was his quaint wild
genius. He looked wistfully at the
still flame of the candle: “It lives
ever in the air!” said he.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What lives ever?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Burley’s voice swelled—“Light!”
He turned from Leonard, and again
contemplated the little flame. “In the
fixed star, in the Will-o’-the-wisp, in
the great sun that illumes half a world,
or the farthing rushlight by which the
ragged student strains his eyes—still
the same flower of the elements. Light
in the universe, thought in the soul—ay—ay—Go
on with the simile. My
head swims. Extinguish the light!
You cannot; fool, it vanishes from
your eye, but it is still in the space.
Worlds must perish, suns shrivel up,
matter and spirit both fall into nothingness,
before the combinations
whose union makes that little flame,
which the breath of a babe can restore
to darkness, shall lose the power to
unite into light once more. Lose the
power!—no, the <em>necessity</em>:—it is the
one <em>Must</em> in creation. Ay, ay, very
dark riddles grow clear now—now
when I could not cast up an addition
sum in the baker’s bill! What wise
man denied that two and two made
four? Do they not make four? I
can’t answer him. But I could
answer a question that some wise
men have contrived to make much
knottier.” He smiled softly, and
turned his face for some minutes to
the wall.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was the second night on which
Leonard had watched by his bedside,
and Burley’s state had grown rapidly
worse. He could not last many days,
perhaps many hours. But he had
evinced an emotion beyond mere
delight at seeing Leonard again. He
had since then been calmer, more
himself. “I feared I might have
ruined you by my bad example,” he
said, with a touch of humour that
became pathos as he added, “That
idea preyed on me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no; you did me great good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say that—say it often,” said
Burley, earnestly; “it makes my
heart feel so light.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He had listened to Leonard’s story
with deep interest, and was fond of
talking to him of little Helen. He
detected the secret at the young
man’s heart, and cheered the hopes
that lay there, amidst fears and sorrows.
Burley never talked seriously
of his repentance; it was not in his
nature to talk seriously of the things
which he felt solemnly. But his high
animal spirits were quenched with
the animal power that fed them.
Now, we go out of our sensual existence
only when we are no longer
enthralled by the Present, in which
the senses have their realm. The
sensual being vanishes when we are
in the Past or the Future. The Present
was gone from Burley; he could
no more be its slave and its king.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was most touching to see how
the inner character of this man unfolded
itself, as the leaves of the outer
character fell off and withered—a
character no one would have guessed
in him—an inherent refinement that
was almost womanly; and he had all
a woman’s abnegation of self. He took
the cares lavished on him so meekly.
As the features of the old man return
in the stillness of death to the aspect
of youth—the lines effaced, the wrinkles
gone—so, in seeing Burley now, you
saw what he had been in his spring
of promise. But he himself saw only
what he had failed to be—powers
squandered—life wasted. “I once
beheld,” he said, “a ship in a storm.
It was a cloudy, fitful day, and I
could see the ship with all its masts
fighting hard for life and for death.
Then came night, dark as pitch, and
I could only guess that the ship
fought on. Towards the dawn the
stars grew visible, and once more I
saw the ship—it was a wreck—it went
down just as the stars shone forth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When he had made that allusion
to himself, he sate very still for some
time, then he spread out his wasted
hands, and gazed on them, and on
his shrunken limbs. “Good,” said
he, laughing low; “these hands were
too large and rude for handling the
delicate webs of my own mechanism,
and these strong limbs ran away with
me. If I had been a sickly puny fellow,
perhaps my mind would have had
fair play. There was too much of
brute body here! Look at this hand
now! you can see the light through
it! Good, good!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, that evening, until he had
retired to bed, Burley had been unusually
cheerful, and had talked with
much of his old eloquence, if with
little of his old humour. Amongst
other matters, he had spoken with considerable
interest of some poems and
other papers in manuscript which had
been left in the house by a former
lodger, and which, the reader may
remember, that Mrs Goodyer had
urged him in vain to read, in his last
visit to her cottage. But <em>then</em> he
had her husband Jacob to chat with,
and the spirit bottle to finish, and
the wild craving for excitement
plucked his thoughts back to his
London revels. Now poor Jacob
was dead, and it was not brandy
that the sick man drank from the
widow’s cruise. And London lay
afar amidst its fogs, like a world
resolved back into nebulæ. So to
please his hostess and distract his
own solitary thoughts, he had condescended
(just before Leonard found
him out) to peruse the memorials of
a life obscure to the world, and new
to his own experience of coarse joys
and woes. “I have been making a
romance, to amuse myself, from their
contents,” said he. “They may be of
use to you, brother author. I have
told Mrs Goodyer to place them in
your room. Amongst those papers
is a journal—a woman’s journal; it
moved me greatly. A man gets into
another world, strange to him as the
orb of Sirius, if he can transport himself
into the centre of a woman’s
heart, and see the life there, so
wholly unlike our own. Things of
moment to us, to it so trivial; things
trifling to us, to it so vast. There
was this journal—in its dates reminding
me of stormy events of my
own existence, and grand doings in
the world’s. And those dates there,
chronicling but the mysterious unrevealed
record of some obscure loving
heart! And in that chronicle, O Sir
Poet, there was as much genius,
vigour of thought, vitality of being,
poured and wasted, as ever kind
friend will say was lavished on the
rude outer world by big John Burley!
Genius, genius; are we all alike, then,
save when we leash ourselves to some
matter-of-fact material, and float over
the roaring seas on a wooden plank
or a herring tub?” And after he had
uttered that cry of a secret anguish,
John Burley had begun to show
symptoms of growing fever and disturbed
brain; and when they had got
him into bed, he lay there muttering
to himself, until towards midnight he
had asked Leonard to bring the light
nearer to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>So now he again was quiet—with
his face turned towards the wall; and
Leonard stood by the bedside sorrowfully,
and Mrs Goodyer, who did not
heed Burley’s talk, and thought only
of his physical state, was dipping
cloths into iced water to apply to his
forehead. But as she approached
with these, and addressed him soothingly,
Burley raised himself on his
arm, and waived aside the bandages.
“I do not need them,” said he, in a
collected voice. “I am better now.
I and that pleasant light understand
one another, and I believe all it tells
me. Pooh, pooh, I do not rave.”
He looked so smilingly and so kindly
into her face, that the poor woman,
who loved him as her own son, fairly
burst into tears. He drew her towards
him and kissed her forehead.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Peace, old fool,” said he fondly.
“You shall tell anglers hereafter how
John Burley came to fish for the one-eyed
perch which he never caught;
and how, when he gave it up at the
last, his baits all gone, and the line
broken amongst the weeds, you comforted
the baffled man. There are
many good fellows yet in the world
who will like to know that poor
Burley did not die on a dunghill.
Kiss me! Come, boy, you too. Now,
God bless you, I should like to sleep.”
His cheeks were wet with the tears
of both his listeners, and there was a
moisture in his own eyes, which
nevertheless beamed bright through
the moisture.</p>

<p class='c010'>He laid himself down again, and
the old woman would have withdrawn
the light. He moved uneasily. “Not
that,” he murmured—“light to the
last!” And putting forth his wan
hand, he drew aside the curtain so
that the light might fall full on his
face. In a few minutes he was asleep,
breathing calmly and regularly as an
infant.</p>

<p class='c010'>The old woman wiped her eyes,
and drew Leonard softly into the adjoining
room, in which a bed had been
made up for him. He had not left the
house since he had entered it with Dr
Morgan. “You are young, sir,” said
she with kindness, “and the young
want sleep. Lie down a bit: I will call
you when he wakes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I could not sleep,” said Leonard.
“I will watch for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old woman shook her head.
“I must see the last of him, sir;
but I know he will be angry when
his eyes open on me, for he has grown
very thoughtful of others.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, if he had but been as thoughtful
of himself!” murmured Leonard;
and he seated himself by the table, on
which, as he leaned his elbow, he dislodged
some papers placed there. They
fell to the ground with a dumb, moaning,
sighing sound.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?” said he starting.</p>

<p class='c010'>The old woman picked up the
manuscripts and smoothed them carefully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, sir, he bade me place these
papers here. He thought they might
keep you from fretting about him, in
case you would sit up and wake.
And he had a thought of me, too; for
I have so pined to find out the poor
young lady, who left them years ago.
She was almost as dear to me as he is;
dearer perhaps until now—when—when—I
am about to lose him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Leonard turned from the papers,
without a glance at their contents:
they had no interest for him at such
a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hostess went on—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps she is gone to heaven
before him; she did not look like one
long for this world. She left us so
suddenly. Many things of hers besides
these papers are still here; but
I keep them aired and dusted, and
strew lavender over them, in case
she ever come for them again. You
never heard tell of her, did you, sir?”
she added, with great simplicity, and
dropping a half curtsey.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of her?—of whom?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did not Mr John tell you her
name—dear—dear;—Mrs Bertram.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Leonard started;—the very name
so impressed upon his memory by
Harley L’Estrange.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bertram!” he repeated. “Are
you sure?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh yes, sir! And many years
after she had left us, and we had heard
no more of her, there came a packet
addressed to her here, from over sea,
sir. We took it in, and kept it, and
John would break the seal, to know
if it would tell us anything about her;
but it was all in a foreign language
like—we could not read a word.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you the packet? Pray show
it to me. It may be of the greatest
value. To-morrow will do—I cannot
think of that just now. Poor Burley!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Leonard’s manner indicated that
he wished to talk no more, and to
be alone. So Mrs Goodyer left him,
and stole back to Burley’s room on
tiptoe.</p>

<p class='c010'>The young man remained in deep
reverie for some moments. “Light,”
he murmured. “How often ‘Light’
is the last word of those round whom
the shades are gathering!”<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c008'><sup>[31]</sup></a> He
moved, and straight on his view
through the cottage lattice there
streamed light, indeed—not the miserable
ray lit by a human hand—but
the still and holy effulgence of a
moonlit heaven. It lay broad upon
the humble floors—pierced across the
threshold of the death chamber, and
halted clear amidst its shadows.</p>

<p class='c010'>Leonard stood motionless, his eye
following the silvery silent splendour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And,” he said inly—“and does
this large erring nature, marred by its
genial faults—this soul which should
have filled a land, as yon orb the
room, with a light that linked earth
to heaven—does it pass away into the
dark, and leave not a ray behind?
Nay, if the elements of light are ever
in the space, and when the flame goes
out, return to the vital air—so thought,
once kindled, lives for ever around
and about us, a part of our breathing
atmosphere. Many a thinker, many
a poet, may yet illume the world,
from the thoughts which yon genius,
that will have no name, gave forth—to
wander through air, and recombine
again in some new form of light.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus he went on in vague speculations,
seeking, as youth enamoured of
fame seeks too fondly, to prove that
mind never works, however erratically,
in vain—and to retain yet, as an influence
upon earth, the soul about to
soar far beyond the atmosphere where
the elements that make fame abide.
Not thus had the dying man interpreted
the endurance of light and
thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly, in the midst of his reverie,
a low cry broke on his ear. He shuddered
as he heard, and hastened forebodingly
into the adjoining room.
The old woman was kneeling by the
bedside, and chafing Burley’s hand—eagerly
looking into his face. A glance
sufficed to Leonard. All was over.
Burley had died in sleep—calmly, and
without a groan.</p>

<p class='c010'>The eyes were half open, with that
look of inexpressible softness which
death sometimes leaves; and still they
were turned towards the light; and
the light burned clear. Leonard
closed tenderly the heavy lids; and,
as he covered the face, the lips smiled
a serene farewell.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>OUR LONDON COMMISSIONER.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c021'>NO. II.</h3>

<p class='c022'>In the northern outskirt of London,
there is a dingy-looking, ill-shaped
building, on the bank of a narrow
canal, where at one time, not very
long ago, real water fell in sparkling
cascades, Trafalgars were fought in
veritable vessels, and, triumphant
over all, radiant in humour and
motley, with wit at his fingers’ ends,
and ineffable character in his feet,
laughed, hobbled, jeered, flouted, and
pirouetted the clown, Joseph Grimaldi.
The audiences, in those days, were
partial to beer.  Tobacco was a
pleasant accompaniment to the wonders
of the scene. Great effect was
produced by farces of a very unsentimental
kind; and the principal
effort of the author was to introduce
as much bustle and as many kicks
into his piece as he could. A bloody
nose secured three rounds of applause;
a smack on the cheek was a successful
repartee; a coarse oath was only
emphatic—nobody blushed, everybody
swore. There were fights in
the pit, and the police-office was near
at hand. It was the one place of
entertainment for a poor and squalid
district. Poverty and dirt went
there to forget themselves, and came
away unimproved. It was better,
perhaps, than the beer-shop, certainly
better than the prize-fight, but not so
good as the tea-garden and hop. This
building is now the Theatre Royal,
Sadler’s Wells, presided over by one
of the best actors on the English
stage, and ringing, night after night,
to the language of Shakspeare and
Massinger. How does the audience
behave? Better than young gentlemen
of the Guards at a concert of
sacred music; better than young
ladies of fashion at a scientific lecture.
They don’t yawn, they don’t giggle,
they don’t whisper to each other at
the finest passages; but there is intense
interest—eyes, heart, mind, all
fixed on the wondrous evolvement of
the story. They stay, hour by hour,
silent, absorbed, attentive, answering
the touch of the magician’s wand,
warming into enthusiasm, or melting
into tears, with as fine an appreciation
of the working of the play as if
they had studied the Greek drama,
and been critics all their days. Are
they the same people, or the same
class of people, who roared and rioted
in the pit in the days of the real
water? Exactly the same. The
boxes are three shillings, the pit a
shilling, the gallery a sixpence.
There are many fustian jackets in the
pit, and in the gallery a sprinkling of
shirt sleeves. Masters of trades, and
respectable shopkeepers, and professional
men, and their families are in
the boxes; and Mr Phelps is as great
a benefactor to that neighbourhood
as if he had established a public park,
or opened a lyceum for education.
There is a perceptible difference, we
are told, in the manners of the district.
You can’t raise a man in any
one department without lifting him
up in all. Improve his mind, you
refine his character; teach him even
mathematics, he will learn politeness;
give him good society, he will cease
to be coarse; introduce him to Shakspeare,
Jonson, Beaumont, Massinger,
and Webster, he will be a gentleman.
A man with friends like these will
not go to the tap of the Black Dog.
Better spend his sixpence at Sadler’s
Wells, and learn what was going on
in Rome in the time of Coriolanus,
or learn the thanklessness of sycophantic
friends in the Athenian
Timon. With the bluff and brutal
Henry VIII. they are quite familiar,
and form a very tolerable idea of a
certain pinchbeck cardinal’s pride,
from the insolence of the overweening
Wolsey. That energy and honour
overcome all impediments, they have
long discovered from the story of the
Lady of Lyons, and the grandeur of
self-devotion in the noble aspirations
of Ion. A world like this opening to
their eyes, reflects a pleasant light on
the common earth they inhabit. “One
touch of nature makes the whole
world kin.” The same sentiment
brings a big sob into their rough
throats, and swells the gentle bosom
of the delicate young lady in the
front row of the dress circle. If the
Queen were there, there would be a
quivering of the royal lip. Jack
Wiggins, the tinman, cries as if he
were flogged. Let us off to see Sadler’s
Wells, where a new play is to
be acted, with our old friend James
VI. for its hero. A pretty hero for a
play!—The pedantic, selfish, ambitious,
and cowardly son of Mary
Stuart, who kissed the hand reeking
with his mother’s blood, and held
out the Scottish crown to be an
awmous-dish, into which Elizabeth
disdainfully threw her niggard charity,
like an old maid depositing a farthing
in the plate at the Magdalen Hospital
door. This play is improperly
called a tragedy, because a few
people happen to be killed in the
course of it. The foundation is decidedly
comic—horribly, grotesquely
comic. There the laughter tries in
vain to banish the shudder, and between
them a compound is created
which we believe to be new to the
stage. The conventional tyrant of
tragedy is entirely done away with.
There are no knittings of brows and
crossings of elbows, starts and struttings,
such as we generally see made
the accompaniments of revenge and
hatred. There is a low, selfish,
cruel nature, disguised in ludicrous
repartee and jocular conversation—a
buffoon animated by the soul of
Richard III., a harlequin’s lath tipt
with deadly poison—our ordinary
ideas turned topsy-turvy, and Polonius
running his sword through
Hamlet behind the arras. Whether
this historical view of James be correct
or not, does not matter to the
play. It is the view chosen by the
author on a preponderating weight of
evidence; and the point of his career
chosen for the development of these
blacker portions of his disposition is
the Gowrie plot, where even the
king’s adulators were unable to hide
the murmurs of the people, who certainly
believed his conduct to have
been cruel and unjust.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such a piece of acting as Mr Phelps’s
presentment of James is rarely seen
on the stage. His command of the
Scotch dialect is wonderful in an Englishman;
his walk, his look, his attitude,
are as palpable indications of
character as the language he employs.
There is not a turn of his mouth, or
a leer of his eye, that is not in harmony
with the general design. His
pride, terror, abasement, doubt,
triumph, and final despair, are all
given with a marvellous versatility,
which yet never trenches on the identity
of the actor’s creation. But touches
are here and there added, some to
soften, some to darken, till the whole
is like a Dutch picture—laboriously
minute in all its details, and perfect
as a finished whole.</p>

<p class='c010'>The English envoy, Sir John Ayliffe,
has been sent by Elizabeth with an
answer to a demand made by James,
that she should proclaim him her
successor on the English throne. He
has diverged from his road to Holyrood
to the castle of the Laird of
Restalrig—the secret, but principal
agent in a plot for seizing the king;
and is greatly alarmed on hearing that
Spanish and Roman agents are at the
Scottish court, promising the king
great pecuniary assistance if he will
march across the Border, and, with
the help of the discontented Catholic
nobility, assert his claim by force.
He therefore agrees to aid Restalrig
in his attempt to secure the king, and
proceeds on his way to Edinburgh.
Lord Gowrie, with his brother, is on
a visit to the Laird, Gowrie being, of
course, in love with his daughter, and
is easily worked on to aid the plot by
hearing of certain indignities which
had been offered to his mother in his
absence by the minions of the king.
He also goes to Edinburgh, and here
we are introduced to his mother, the
widowed countess, who urges him to
revenge her wrongs, and vindicate his
honour by confronting the oppressor.
Restalrig has also come to the capital,
encounters his friend Gomez, the Spanish
agent, and is by him requested to
take care of certain sums of gold which
have been sent over for the purpose of
purchasing the assistance of the nobles
to the views of Spain. We now come
into the court of Holyrood. James
gabbles, and storms, and fleeches,
and goes through the most strange,
yet natural evolutions—hears a negative
reply from England delivered by
Sir John Ayliffe—is startled by the
apparition of Gowrie drest in his
father’s arms—and dismisses the court
with a threat of vengeance against all
his opponents, especially the heirs of
his old enemy, Lord Ruthven.</p>

<p class='c010'>The interest of the plot hangs on
the intellectual combat between the
wily and sagacious laird, and the
truculent and relentless king. With
some of the gold obtained from the
Spaniard, Restalrig induces James to
move the court to Falkland, in order
to be more easily seized when in the
vicinity of Gowrie’s house; but James
carries his design farther, and goes
into the mansion of the Gowries,
having arranged with his train to
follow him, and make themselves
masters of his hosts. When Restalrig’s
triumph in the success of his
plan and the imprisonment of the
king is at its height, a chivalrous
sense of honour in the young earl has
disconcerted the whole design, by
restoring James to liberty, and admitting
his followers. Slaughter then
takes place; but while James is
rejoicing in his gratified revenge, and
the destruction of his enemies, it is
announced to him that Restalrig, at
the head of the men of Perth, is at
the gate; they are clamorous for
vengeance—the alarm-bells are ringing—strange
yells of an outraged
populace are heard—James, in an
agony of cowardly remorse, blames
the instruments of his cruelty—and
the curtain falls, leaving him in immediate
expectation of being torn to
pieces in punishment of his useless
crime. The performers have little to
do in this play, except to bring out
the peculiarities of the king. Restalrig
is played with a rough humour,
and appreciation of the part, by Mr
Bennet; but the effect of the young
earl, upon whom a great deal depends
in the scene of the release, is entirely
destroyed by the unfortunate voice
and feebleness of the actor. As an
exhibition, however, of how one great
performer can vivify a whole play in
spite of all drawbacks, we pronounce
the acting of Mr Phelps in some
respects without a parallel on the
modern stage.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the good old comedy of the
“Man of the World,” he is no less
remarkable in his delineation of Sir
Pertinax Macsycophant. His power
over the Scotch dialect is the same;
and it is only a less powerful performance,
from the character itself being
less diversified, and the tragic element
being entirely omitted. Disagreeable
characters both, from their hardness
and selfishness; and we should like
to see the same art applied to some
softer and more captivating specimens
of the Scottish species.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have been forced already to
confess that single-character pieces
are the only style of drama to which
full justice can be done in any theatre
in London. Many people, deluded by
this circumstance, and preferring the
perfection of one to the mediocrity of
many, will gravely tell you that the
drama itself ought to be formed, in
this respect, on the model of the
stage; that the interest ought to be
concentred in the hero, and the others
kept entirely subordinate, or at least
only endowed with vitality enough to
enable them to survive the kicks and
buffets with which the chief personage
of the plot asserts his superiority.
That one central interest must exist in
a properly-constructed drama, there
is no doubt; but it is a terrible narrowing
of the author’s walk if you
debar him from affixing this interest
to a group, and limit it entirely to
one. You force him to descend to
mere peculiarities, and the evolvement
of character in its most contracted
sense—thereby, and to this extent,
trenching upon the province of farce,
which consists in a development of
the humours of some selected individual.
The drama, on the other hand,
paints humanity in the abstract,
modified in its particular action by the
position and character of the personages
of the story; and in so far as,
for the sake of one chief actor, the
movement of the play is made to
depend on him, the poet sinks from
being the Titian or Michael Angelo of
his art, into the Watson Gordon, Phillips,
or Pickersgill;—high names certainly;
but portrait-painting, even at
its best, is not history. Let any man
read <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite>, and think of the
Kembles, Young, Macready, and
Elliston all in the same play, and
talk no more of a one-charactered
drama as the fittest for representation,
and the highest of its class. A one-charactered
drama is only the best
when there is but one good actor in a
theatre; if there were three good
actors, a three-charactered play would
speedily arise; where all were good,
Shakspeare would reappear—that is
to say, crowds would go to see
Shakspeare, instead of going, as now,
to see this or that performer in Hamlet
or Macbeth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The nearest approach to this diffusion
of excellence is to be found on
the French stage. A unity of purpose
is visible in the whole company.
The flunky who announces the countess’s
carriage enters into the spirit
of the scene, and is as completely the
flunky, and nothing more, as Regnier
is the marquis, and nothing less.
But one man we possess on the English
boards, who is very superior to
Regnier and all his clan. Charles
Matthews has more graceful ease,
more untiring vivacity, more genial
comprehension, than the very finest
of the Parisians. For ninety-five
nights he has held a hushed theatre
in the most complete subjection to his
magic art, and was as fresh and forcible
on the last night of the course
as at its beginning. Yet never once
does he raise his voice above drawing-room
pitch; no reliance has he on
silver shoe-buckles or slashed doublets;
he wears the same coat and
other habiliments in which he breakfasts
at home or dines with a friend.
Never once does he point an epigram
with a grimace, or even emphasise a
sentiment with a shrug of his shoulders.
The marvel is how the effect
is created; for there is no outward
sign of effort or intention. That the
effect is there, is manifest from pit to
gallery; and yet, there stands a quiet,
placid, calm-eyed, pleasant-mannered,
meek-voiced, bald-headed, gentlemanly
stockbroker, with respectable brass-buttoned
blue coat and grey trousers,
such as is to be seen on any day of
the week pursuing his way from St
John’s Wood or Brompton; and, at
first sight, as unfit for theatrical representation
as the contents of his
ledger for the material of an epic
poem. But he is placed in queer and
unaccountable situations?—made intensely
interesting by some strange
instance of mistaken identity?—or endangered
in life and fame by some
curiously ingenious piece of circumstantial
evidence? Nothing of the
kind. The man is before you all the
time. You know his whole circumstances
as well as he himself does. He
has a wife and daughter; he lives in
a well-furnished capacious house—we
should say in the upper part of
Baker Street; and probably a brass
plate reveals to the inquiring passenger
that it is the residence of Mr Affable
Hawk. That is his name: a
merchant or stockbroker, at one time
very honest and very rich; but his
partner, a Mr Sparrow, has eloped
with the co-partnery funds, leaving
Mr Hawk’s affairs in inextricable confusion,
and throwing him into the
disagreeable necessity of living on his
wits. He has a great and available
capital, and lays it out to the best
advantage. Never did wits so stand in
the stead of money before. With them
he pays off debts, with them he embarks
in speculations, and on their
security raises loans throwing seed
in the stoniest places, and receiving
a hundredfold. Nor is his triumph
over a set of trustful spinsters, or persons
unaccustomed to business. He
does not live upon pigeons, but, like
the lovers in Boccaccio, makes an excellent
dinner on a sharp-beaked falcon.
Mr Hardcore will stand no
more nonsense. He rushes into the
house—hat on head, stick in hand.
He will have his money, or issue a
writ at once. With a gentlemanly
motion towards his head, Mr Affable
convicts him silently of ill-breeding
and impertinence, and the hat is instantly
removed. With the utmost
suavity, he requests the irate creditor
to write to his clerk to stop farther
proceedings, and to add, in a postscript,
a cheque for £200. The man
is staggered by the immensity of the
impertinence. But the calm superiority
of his debtor makes itself felt in
spite of his utmost efforts. Certain
shares in a brilliant speculation have
been secured by Mr Hawk for his
friend at a very low premium. The
letter to the clerk is written. But
the cheque for £200? Sir Harry Lester,
a rich baronet, is about to marry
Mr Hawk’s daughter; all debts are
to be paid by the enraptured son-in-law;
a fitting breakfast must be
given; a few trinkets, a few dresses.
You wouldn’t have such a glorious
prospect spoiled by the want of such
a trifle? Hardcore writes the cheque,
and rushes off to secure the depreciated
shares. Another comes in who
throws himself on the charity of his
debtor, pleads poverty, distress, even
starvation. How can the polished
and humane Mr Hawk resist so touching
an appeal? He can’t. He doesn’t.
He goes for three pounds, as an instalment
of which it appears he has
already paid nine, making a remarkably
good return on the loan of our
penurious friend, Mr Earthworm.
That gentleman rejoices in the success
of his “dodge,” and appears triumphant
in his conquest over the
feelings of Mr Hawk. But the benevolent
debtor now returns, pays the
three sovereigns, and hurries his visitor
off to make way for Mr Grossmark,
who is about to purchase shares
in a speculation of Mr Hawk’s, which
is to yield three hundred per cent.
“How much is required?” says the
miserable Earthworm—“three hundred
pounds?” He thinks he can
raise the sum—a friend who is very
rich will help him: he will advance
the money. “But the four hundred
pounds are required at once.” “Is it
<em>four</em> hundred?” A bow from Mr
Hawk. “Well, my friend will not
stick at that.” “And the five hundred
pounds will set the matter
afloat,” said Mr Hawk; “but go—there’s
a good fellow—for I hear
Grossmark’s step, and the shares are
promised to him.” Earthworm’s disguise
is seen through, and falls off
like the traveller’s cloak before the
heat of the sun. “Here! here’s the
money,” he cries—puts a pile of notes
into Mr Hawk’s reluctant hand, and
the bargain is closed. Prosperity
once more seems an inhabitant of
Baker Street. He has received seven
hundred pounds, and can now provide
a trousseau, and furnish forth a wedding
breakfast. Twenty thousand
pounds he has settled on his daughter;
but they are any twenty thousand he
may be able to extract from the
uncountable riches of his son-in-law.
This noble specimen of
Hibernian honour rejoices in a double
name; one being Sir Harry Lester,
with which to tickle the ears of the
millionaires of Baker Street, and the
other his workday appellation under
which he enacts the distinguished
part of a stag in railways, and a defaulter
in other speculations. His
interview with Mr Hawk would be
diamond cut diamond if the strength
and brilliancy weren’t all on one side.
Preliminaries are settled—the amount
of marriage portion agreed upon—a
description of the Lester estates, including
a salt marsh taken on trust,
and all things verging towards a satisfactory
fulfilment. The salt marsh
instantly suggests to the ingenious
Hawk a perfect California of speculation;
divided into shares, market
rigged, property realised, and no other
inquiries are made. But the course
of true love never did run smooth.
In the most dramatic scene of the
play, the mutual discovery is made
that Mr Hawk is an insolvent, and
Sir Harry a swindler—the Lester
estates are in an Irish bog, the salt
marsh is the sea. Pleasant is it to
see the mild self-composure, and sublime
self-reliance of Mr Hawk. For
some years he has softened his creditors’
hearts, and amused their hopes
with reports of the return of his
runaway partner Mr Sparrow, with
all the funds of the firm, and a vast
increase of capital by successful trade
in the East. That expedient has been
tried so often that it begins to lose its
effect. The creditors laugh when he
mentions Sparrow’s name. What can
be better than to make Sir Harry
bronze his countenance, shave off his
beard, put on a wig, buy a carriage in
Long Acre, and post up to Baker
Street at the very moment, decisive
of his fate, when his creditors, now
aware of the failure of his chance of
marrying his daughter to a fortune,
are to assemble with their united
claims and remorselessly convey him
to the Fleet? Sir Harry agrees.
Hawk retires to mature his plans;
but Mrs Hawk, radiant with some
unexpected good news, hurries in—stops
Sir Harry from the execution of
his infamous plot, and waits in happy
expectation the <em>dénouement</em> of the
piece. The creditors come in—they
bawl, they grin, they scold, they
bully. Sparrow is appealed to in
vain. They have heard too much of
that Levanter’s return to believe in it
any more. Hark! a carriage rattles
up to the door. They look out of the
window: carriage covered with mud;—old
fellow hobbles out—pigtail
wig exactly as ordered. Capital,
Sir Harry, cries Hawk! Now, then,
gentlemen, will you be persuaded?
Won’t you wait for ten days till I have
arranged our partnership accounts,
and then we will pay you in full?
The creditors pause. At last one of
them goes out to see. He comes
back with a cheque for the amount
of his debt! Hawk stands aghast.
Another goes out, and comes in holding
up a bank post bill for ten
thousand pounds! More and more
confounded. Hawk has uncomfortable
thoughts of forgery, and thinks
Sir Harry carries the joke too far.
At last the wife of his bosom rushes
in, and at the other door Sir Harry
makes his appearance. This is magic,
witchcraft, sorcery; for still the creditors
go out, and still come back with
all their claims discharged. The real
Sparrow has indeed returned; and,
having thus made the <em>amende</em>, is in a
position to solicit an interview with
his injured partner; and that sagacious
and now thoroughly honourable
gentleman concludes the series of his
“dodges” with a solemn declaration
in favour of probity and fair-dealing,
which would have been more edifying
if he could have appealed to his own
conduct in illustration of what he said.
There was no occasion for any piece
of hypocrisy like this at the end.
His life was a sermon. We have
heard an objection made to the moral
of this play, that it invests swindling
with dignity, and so unites dishonesty
with wit, ease, grace, and fascinating
manner, as to make dishonesty itself
far from a repulsive object. Have
you ever reflected, oh critic, that
the creditors here are the helots of
the scene, to be a disgust and warning
to others; and, in the midst of
their apparent respectabilities, are
shown to be the dishonest workers
of their own losses?—that Mr Hawk
is far less the tempter of those City
gentlemen, than the creation of the
style of speculation in which they
are all engaged. Without Earthworms
and Hardcores there would
be no possible existence for our easy,
pleasant, buoyant friend Hawk. The
whole play may be called “Rochefoucauld’s
Maxims Dramatised;” for
a better satire on the selfishness,
meanness, and gullibility of the animal
man is not to be found in the
whole range of literature or philosophy.
What little is to be done by
Mr Roxby, as Sir Harry, is done
“excellent well.” There is a very
praiseworthy obtuseness to the rascality
of his conduct, and calm consideration
of his claims, which is
very edifying as contrasted with the
thorough appreciation of him instantaneously
arrived at by his intended
father-in-law. The principal creditors
also are very adequately represented,
especially the miserable begging impostor,
by Mr Frank Matthews. A
more life-like combination of mendicity,
and its unvarying accompaniment
mendacity, was never observed
by Mr Horsford; and we confess to
a feeling approaching displeasure,
when we learn that the beneficent
Sparrow has restored his money to
that smooth-tongued, supple-backed,
blackhearted vagabond. Now, what
is the conclusion derived from all
this?—That a dramatic feast of this
quality has not been seen in our time.
Not that the language is comparable
to Sheridan’s—in fact, the composition
is rather poor; not even that there is
any novelty in the plot;—but the
strength of this play is first of all in
the prevailing truthfulness of Charles
Matthews’ acting; and, secondly,
that it never on any one occasion
oversteps the modesty of nature.
With the sole exception of the opportune
return of the defaulting partner,
we believe that the entire story of
this drama was enacted every day in
the neighbourhood of Capel Court all
the time of the railway mania, and is
now performing every day not far
from the Stock Exchange. And the
proof that this lecture, as it may be
called, on the art of commercial
gambling, is carried on in accordance
with inevitable natural laws, is that in
spite of the English names, the Irish
baronet, the Baker Street furniture,
and the thoroughly London atmosphere
that surrounds all the personages
introduced, the play is originally
French. The scene is Paris—the
creditors are Parisian—the swindling,
speculating, caballing, kite-flying, and
mystification, are all originally the
offspring of the Bourse; and all the
merit of the English play-wright is,
that he has very ingeniously hidden
the birthplace of his characters, without
altering, or in the slightest degree
damaging, their features; and, in fact,
has given them letters of naturalisation
under which they could rise to
be Lord Mayors of London, and eat
turtle and drink port as if to the
manner born. The author is poor
Balzac, lately dead, who left <cite>Mercadet</cite>
a legacy to the stage of more
value by far than all his contributions
to it during his lifetime. His minute
dissection of character had given a
charm to his novels, but gave no promise
of a success upon the boards;
for his ends were worked out by a
thousand little traits, as in our own
Miss Austin, without ever having
recourse to the broad effects that
seem adapted to the theatre;—and we
believe his dramatic triumph came as
a surprise upon the Parisian public,
which, at the same time, highly
appreciated his Eugenie Grandet, and
his other revelations of provincial life.</p>

<p class='c010'>While dwelling on the performances
of the Lyceum, it would be unpardonable
to omit, from the notice of Maga
and her readers, the genius of Mr
Beverley, the scene-painter. It almost
requires an apology for applying
that old appellation to a man who
lavishes upon the landscapes required
in a play a richness of imagination
and power of touch which would bring
envy to the hearts of the Poussins or
Claude. It is not by gorgeous colours,
or startling light and shade, that Beverley
produces his effects. With a
severe adherence to his original design,
he works out a scene, so perfect
in its parts, and so combined as a
whole, that it is difficult to realise to
the mind the gigantic scale, or the
coarse touches, with which it is painted:
you gaze on it as on a finished
picture by some great artist, who has
devoted months to its elaboration in
the solitude of his studio; and wonder
not less at the taste, and fancy, and
sentiment of those extraordinary
works, than at the rapidity with which
they are produced, and the inexhaustible
resources of the mind that gives
them birth. It rests with Mr Beverley
himself, whether to follow his
illustrious predecessors, Roberts and
Stanfield, to the highest honours of
the Academy, or to continue an exhibition
of his own, where the applause
of shouting theatres testifies nightly
to his artistic powers; and ample room
and verge enough is given for his
highest conceptions, which would,
perhaps, object to find themselves
cramped within the limits of an ordinary
frame, and subjected to the tender
mercies of a hostile hanging committee.
Whichever way he decides,
the arts will infallibly be the gainers.
If he descends to ordinary canvass,
and places “infinite riches in a little
room,” he will take rank in after ages
with the masters who have ennobled
the English school; if he continues
where he is, not less useful will his
efforts be in diffusing a love of beauty
and a knowledge of effect. The Lyceum,
like its Athenian prototype,
will become a lecture-hall; and from
his lessons and examples, new Wilsons
and Turners, new Calcotts and
Constables, may arise to maintain
the supremacy of British landscape
against all competitors.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our readers must remember a very
spirited account of an ascent of Mont
Blanc by Mr Albert Smith. Very
spirited, and very interesting it was;
but you should go and hear the author
give his <em>vivâ voce</em> version of it, illustrated
by Beverley’s views. When
we say the descriptions are funny, we
are not correct; though certainly there
is a great deal of whim and fun in the
course of his address. When we say
the narrative is grave, startling, entrancing,
we are not correct; though,
undoubtedly, there are passages that
take away the auditor’s breath, and
hair-breadth ’scapes that make him
shudder;—but the true description of
the whole two hours’ entertainment
is, that it is a remarkable combination
of talent, humour, lucid narrative,
and personal adventure, which everybody
ought to go and hear, and a succession
of scenes and paintings which
everybody ought to go and see. The
deaf man will be delighted; the blind
man will be amazingly pleased; but
people in the full enjoyment of eyes
and ears will be inexcusable, if they
refuse them so great a treat as the
united efforts of two such artists will
afford.</p>

<p class='c010'>Saturday—and the week’s inspection
has come to a close. A cold east
wind is howling along Oxford Street,
evidently in search of snow, and rather
disappointed at not finding the
Serpentine covered with ice. The
Almanac tells us it is April; but our
extremities have private information
that it is December. As we go shivering
home, we will diverge for a
moment into the most curious repository
of nick-nacks the world contains—being
the gatherings of thirty years,
at a cost of thirty thousand pounds.
We call in Argyll Street, and are
civilly received by Mr Hertz, the proprietor
of the collection. He is a little,
round, oily-faced German, evidently
of the Jewish persuasion, and remarkably
fond of tobacco. His room is
like a pawnbroker’s shop; only all his
customers must have been possessors
of picture galleries, and have brought
themselves into difficulties by cultivating
a “taste.” There are wardrobes
richly inlaid, with a genealogy
as carefully kept as the pedigree of a
race-horse. He will tell you how it
came into the hands of Louis XIV.,
and how it ornamented a chamber in
the Tuileries during the Empire; or
a ring will be shown you, with the
hair of Julius Cæsar under the glass.
Beautiful miniatures are pointed out,
of great value as works of art, but far
more valuable from their being undoubted
likenesses of their fair and
famous originals. Beauties of the
reign of Francis; eyes that looked
kindly on Henry IV.; cheeks that
flushed in vain to win a transient
smile from the Grand Monarque, are
all there. Then there are little ivory
cabinets, and screens magnificently
embroidered, all with their respective
stories—there being no article that
depends entirely on its intrinsic merits,
but borrows a great part of its
interest from the adventures it has
gone through. Finally, he gives you
a key, and sends you off, under the
guardianship of his maid, to a house
in Great Marlborough Street, which
you find filled, from cellar to garret,
with works of a still more valuable
description. We have only time to
mention some very fine cartoons by
Correggio, and a splendid statue
in black marble of a Roman prizefighter.
This is a very fine specimen
of ancient skill. Mr Hertz’s object
is to sell the entire collection, and we
believe he declines to dispose of it
piecemeal. Were this not the case,
it would be indispensable for the
country to secure some of the treasures
here contained, though it would
perhaps be asking too much of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer to endow
the British Museum with the miscellaneous
articles by which the
statue and cartoons are accompanied.
Colder, colder still, and fast and
furious we hurry towards our chambers.
What do blockheads and poetasters
of all ages mean by the balmy
breath of April?—the sunny showers
of April?—the “smiles and tears
together” characteristic of that hopeful
and delicious month? We believe
it is a cuckoo note, continued by imitative
mediocrity from the days of
Theocritus. All very well for him in
the beautiful climate of Sicily to
cover the head of Spring with fresh
flowers, and lie upon the grass playing
his Pandean pipes. But where
are flowers to be seen, at this most
uncheering season, here? Or who can
lie down on the grass before the end
of July without the certainty of cold
and rheumatism? Here has the cold
wind been blowing for two months—sneezes
and snufflings loading every
breeze; and yet you turn to a pastoral
poem, an eclogue or rhapsody,
about the beauties of nature, and you
read whole passages in praise of
April! With our hat clenched over
our brow, and a handkerchief held to
our mouth, we career madly through
Leicester Square. On the steps of
Miss Linwood’s old exhibition, a man
is standing enveloped in ancient
armour. He might as well be cased
in ice. But utterly unconscious seems
he of the absurdity of his appearance,
or of the cold that must be shot
through him from steel cuirass and
iron greaves. In a gentle voice he
addresses the passer by. “It is useless
to observe,” he says, “that all
intelligent individuals will be gratified
by a sight of the strongest man in
the world.” This is so different from
the usual style of those touters, that
we involuntarily slacken our pace.
“It is scarcely necessary,” he proceeds,
“to remark that Professor
Crosso is decidedly at the head of
his profession, and that the entrance
money is only one shilling.” We are
won by the smooth volubility of the
knightly orator. Who is Professor
Crosso?—and what is his profession?
We ascended the steps, traversed a
gallery, deposited a shilling, and
entered a large apartment with a
number of wooden benches, a small
gallery at the back, and a green
curtain door, hiding for a time the
wonders of the stage. Three fiddlers
strung their instruments with most
unholy discord; the company gradually
dropped in, principally foreigners;
the gas gave a leap of increased
light; a tune began, and the curtain
rose. Oh, earth and sky! what is this
we behold? A <i><span lang="fr">tableau-vivant</span></i> of the
death of Hector. Old Priam, venerable
from the length of his beard, is
the central figure; around him sit the
maids and matrons of Troy. Hector
lies dead in front; and to slow music,
the stage on which they stand
is whirled round so as to give a
variety of views of the same group,
and great applause rewards the display.
There is certainly a great
scarcity of drapery about the principal
figures, but nothing to be found
fault with on the score of decorum
or propriety; but we read in a small
hand-bill that the <em>artistes</em> are all
German, and we gaze with great
curiosity on the development of the
Teutonic form. The round hilarious
faces, the flat noses, and prominent
chins, would prove, to the entire satisfaction
of Professor Owen, that our
Bavarian friends were lineal descendants
of the Caffres at the Cape.
There was not a single one of the
Trojan ladies who did not look well
practised in asking the inhabitants to
buy a broom. The sons of Priam seemed
waiters from the foreign <em>restaurants</em>
in Lisle Street; and the dead Hector
had a strong resemblance to the owner
of a small cigar-shop, where there is
a card in the window with the words,
“Hier sprecht Mann Deutsch.”
There were other subjects illustrated,
but all by the same <em>artistes</em>. The
figures were very tastefully disposed;
but a little more beauty, and a closer
approximation to the outlines of the
Canova Venus, would be a great
improvement. However, the patriotic
audience were highly gratified,
and the Dutch ideal evidently fulfilled.
Performances then began,
where there was a display of strength
which would be incredible if there was
no trick in some of the displays. The
professor tossed weights about which
were more fit for waggons than
human arms. An immense iron bar
was laid upon the floor, which he
first lifted by the middle with unanimous
approbation; he then raised it,
keeping it horizontal by a hold
about one-third from the end. He
then laid it down, and grasping one
end of it, certainly succeeded in raising
the other end from the ground,
while the minutest observation could
detect no hair suspended from the
ceiling, nor other means by which
he could be assisted in the feat. But
the crowning performance, which was
preceded by a long pause, to enable
“the yellow-haired and blue-eyed
Saxons” to recover from their surprise,
was called the Harmless Guillotine,
and consisted in cutting off a girl’s
head, without doing her any harm.
The professor walked in leading his
victim by the hand. She was probably
one of the Trojan maidens, and
by no means so favourable a specimen
of female charms as the Argive Helen.
With a vast amount of guttural and
other splutter, the professor addressed
the audience in German; and was
interpreted by one of the fiddlers for
the benefit of any untravelled Englishman
who might be present. The
object of the speech was to beg the
ladies not to be alarmed at what
they are about to see; for though
the head appeared to be cut off, he
assured them, on his own word as a
gentleman and a Christian, that it was
mere deception, and that he was by no
means the murderer he appeared. He
then led away his victim, and placed
her on a kind of sofa-bed at the back
of the stage, and drew the curtains
round her. He next advanced, and
asked whether the company would
have the execution done behind the
curtain or in front? There was a
unanimous answer to this, that we
wished to see the operation; whereupon
he drew the curtain, waved a
sword two or three times, and appeared
to saw away at the girl’s
neck, till finally the head came off,
and in a triumphant manner he held
it up for popular applause. It was
a failure. The stage was so dark,
the figure so indistinct, the preparation
so clumsy, that we could not by
any means entertain the feelings of
horror and astonishment he intended
to produce. The fiddler, in a feeble
voice, invited any of the ladies or
gentlemen present to go on the stage
and examine more nearly the separated
head and its marks of reality.
But nobody responded to the invitation;
and again we fixed our hat
desperately over our brows, and faced
once more the pitiless blowings of
the April breeze.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus have we attempted to give a
clear and dispassionate view of some
of the amusements offered to the
millions of London. The list we
have chosen is very limited; for, in
this communication we have omitted
all mention of the great majority of
the theatres, the operas, the <i><span lang="fr">salles de
danse</span></i>, the panoramas, the dioramas,
and other pictorial exhibitions. What
we wish to impress on the intelligent
reader is the absolute necessity of
improving, and turning to as beneficial
purpose as possible, the means
of entertainment which already exist.
The theatre, we maintain, has in
itself the material most fitted for this
purpose; not the theatre of show and
spectacle, of burlesque and buffoonery,
but the theatre of life and poetry.
The machinery is already there, the
actors capable of improvement, the
drama ready to spring into fresh
existence, and all that is wanted is
the fostering presence of good and
benevolent men—wise enough to see
the immense engine, for good or for
evil, which it is in their power to
direct, and brave enough, in the confidence
of a good cause, to despise
the sneers of the ignorant. The
amusements of the people, properly
considered, are as important as their
ability to spell, or even as the comfort
of their houses; and the philanthropic
economist who spreads the
light of education into desolate lanes,
and brightens, with cleanliness and
convenience, the poor man’s room,
only half executes his task if he does
not afford intellectual recreation to
the mechanic who has a shilling or two
to spare, but leaves him to the false
encitement of the melodrama, or the
leer and vulgarity of the tea-garden.</p>

<p class='c010'>But this is Sunday morning, and
we are at Woolwich in time for
changing guard. Here are four or
five thousand artillery, and a regiment
or two of dragoons; and what
with cadets and engineers, the fighting
population must be close on seven
thousand men. The heath spreads
its smooth hard surface in front of
the parade-ground, and scattered all
over the place are cannons and carriages,
and mortars and implements
of warfare enough to exterminate the
human race in half-an-hour. There
are no such fine intelligent-looking
men as the artillery in the British
service. Great care is taken in the
selection of recruits; for the duties
even of a private need both bodily
and mental activity. Their pay is
higher than that of the line, and their
conduct so good, that out of that immense
body only four have made
their appearance before a magistrate
for the last two years.</p>

<p class='c010'>The quiet of the town is wonderful.
There is not a uniform anywhere
to be seen, except where the sentry,
with drawn sword, guards the heath
gates. On this great expanse there
is no motion. A flag here and there
sways to and fro in the breeze, and
occasionally the burst of a bugle-call
rises into the air from some distant
barrack-yard. But now a few officers
and their wives and families move
silently about—fine handsome lads
come down by twos and threes from
the college of cadets—white-haired
generals, and majors and captains
scarcely less white-haired, pace solemnly
along the gravel—and, finally,
we all arrive at the door of the barrack
chapel, which is guarded by sentinels,
and devoted entirely to the
garrison. On entering on the ground
line we are surprised to find ourselves
in the gallery. On the different pew
doors the ranks and designations of
the occupants are written—general
officers, field-officers, officers, &#38;c. &#38;c.;
and on going forward to the front of
the seat, and looking down into the
body of the building, we see already
assembled the men of the 4th Dragoons
on the cross-benches in front
of the pulpit, and artillerymen on the
seats under the gallery. A beautiful
sight—above a thousand gallant fellows
in their blue trousers with red or
yellow stripes, their belts crossed,
their side-arms on, and all exhibiting
any medals or decorations they may
possess. A corporal in full uniform
acted as clerk, and the band played
the anthems, while some military
choristers sang the hymns and responses.
Better behaviour it is impossible
to see in a church. It was a
calm, observant, and very attentive
congregation. After the prayers, the
clergyman, who rejoices in a very fine
voice, commenced his sermon amid
the hushed attention of his audience.
He was very plain, very straightforward,
and spoke to them as men who
had duties which were by no means
inconsistent with the Christian character.
Their temptations he touched
upon, and gave them warnings and
advice. In about a quarter of an
hour, having seen that his admonition
had had its effect—for he
preached without book, and kept his
eye on his congregation the whole
time—he dismissed them with their
faculties unfatigued, and what he had
told them fresh upon their minds.
On standing up or kneeling down,
the clash of their swords upon the
pavement was very fine; the jingle
of spurs also was heard whenever
they moved; and not the less gallantly
will they press their horses’
flanks, and sway their sabres in some
deathful charge, that they heard and
treasured the lessons of their friend
the chaplain. We intend, on some
future occasion, to devote a whole
paper to a day at Woolwich, but we
have already seen enough to take off
the edge of our fear of a French invasion.
With Hardinge at the head
of our Ordnance, and the great name
of Wellington still sounding in the
hearts of his countrymen—with rifle
corps innumerable, and the whole
empire ready to rise at the first
beacon that flares on Beachy Head—we
shall only observe to the whole
world in arms, that if by some miracle
it finds its way to English ground, it
will receive the most tremendous
thrashing that ever a world in arms,
or out of them, received since history
began. We therefore solemnly advise
all foreign nations, kings, princes,
adventurers, bullies, and personages
whatsoever, to keep a civil tongue in
their heads, and stay quietly at
home.</p>

      <div class='line'>Such as, amid the perils of the strife,</div>
      <div class='line'>The conflict of existence, pine and sigh</div>

      <div class='line'>And brave resistance did but seem to him</div>
      <div class='line'>Another step that led him to the heights.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Ten years had poured their various gifts on earth</div>
      <div class='line'>Of death and life, of sunshine and of shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since Michael left his little school disgraced</div>
      <div class='line'>By acts of lawless violence; and went</div>
      <div class='line'>Back to a ruined parent’s ruined home,</div>
      <div class='line'>To feed his heart on innutritious dreams</div>
      <div class='line'>And idle scorn of those he would not know.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Once when the lights of English Autumn time,</div>
      <div class='line'>Clear, vigorous, spirit-cheering, morning lights,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were dancing on a thousand thousand trees,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were streaming on a thousand fertile fields,</div>
      <div class='line'>And smoking on a hundred cottage tops,</div>
      <div class='line'>He felt that these, once his, were his no more:</div>
      <div class='line'>A stranger ploughed his very garden plots;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Halls, where his forefathers fed the shire,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were fallen, and the stones and timbers sold;</div>
      <div class='line'>One-tenth of all the house, one-hundredth part</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the broad lands, and how much less part still</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the respect and power that graced the name,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would cleave to him the heir. So slow had been</div>
      <div class='line'>The gradual alienation, that till now</div>
      <div class='line'>He had not felt it fully; but that morn</div>
      <div class='line'>(’Twas Sabbath) they had been to worship God,</div>
      <div class='line'>And even in the very Church, where once</div>
      <div class='line'>The service staid for them, and bells rang on</div>
      <div class='line'>Till good Sir Marmaduke, in coach of state,</div>
      <div class='line'>Drawn by six solemn Flanders steeds, and girt</div>
      <div class='line'>By a full score of stalwart serving men,</div>
      <div class='line'>Approaching, gave the signal to begin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even there a London Scrivener, with his brood</div>
      <div class='line'>Of pale and purse-proud children of the fog,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sate in their ancient place, beneath the crest</div>
      <div class='line'>Which Black Sir Walter wore at Agincourt;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ay, over the cold stones, where lies at peace</div>
      <div class='line'>The knight who fell at Naseby, by his King,</div>
      <div class='line'>There sate his steward’s grandson.</div>
      <div class='line in22'>“Ah,” thought Michael,</div>
      <div class='line'>“The desolate abomination stands</div>
      <div class='line'>Most proudly where it ought not; ’tis not these</div>
      <div class='line'>I blame, but gold, the cursed cause of all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gold that o’erthrew my fathers, and raised these,</div>
      <div class='line'>These—and why not me also?” till he swore</div>
      <div class='line'>That gold, and gold alone, should be his god,</div>
      <div class='line'>As who alone rewards its worshippers.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Therefore,” he said, “dear Idol, I to thee</div>
      <div class='line'>From henceforth pay my vows; thou who dost raise</div>
      <div class='line'>The Beggar, till the Princes of the Earth</div>
      <div class='line'>Bow low to kiss his stirrup; who dost give</div>
      <div class='line'>Power and distinction, virtue and renown.</div>
      <div class='line'>My name shall be among the fortunate,</div>
      <div class='line'>For I am of those whose will is Destiny.</div>
      <div class='line'>And then, perhaps, when Victory shall be mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>My Margaret will not turn away from me,</div>
      <div class='line'>As now, methinks, even she must wish to do.”</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The thought was inspiration: all on fire,</div>
      <div class='line'>He wrote to one, their noble house’s chief,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose voice was heard at Eastern council boards;</div>
      <div class='line'>And with the ardour of a youthful heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>He urged his claim: “His Lordship knew him well,</div>
      <div class='line'>The soldier’s spirit He felt; for He was strong;—</div>
      <div class='line'>The influence of wind, or sun, or rain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Could never sap His sinews: were it his</div>
      <div class='line'>To draw a sword in yonder golden land,</div>
      <div class='line'>He promised them no niggard of himself,</div>
      <div class='line'>No slothful wearer of a scarlet coat,</div>
      <div class='line'>Most terrible to women.”</div>
      <div class='line in22'>Marvel not</div>
      <div class='line'>That Michael took the final step alone;</div>
      <div class='line'>His Mother never knew a wish but his;</div>
      <div class='line'>His Father, ah, the sorrows of decay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sorrow-taught indulgence, made him cold,</div>

      <div class='line'>Were crowned with triumph; he got store of gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>But lost his sense of honour.</div>

      <div class='line'>And with much prostrate bending, prayed to Him</div>
      <div class='line'>Who made the morning and the even-tide.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Suddenly came upon them, unawares,</div>
      <div class='line'>The soldiers of the castle, bound their arms,</div>
      <div class='line'>And drove them, harshly, o’er the plain, on foot,</div>
      <div class='line'>Weary and terror-stricken, through the gate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the presence hall, where sate their chief.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sternly he questioned Michael of his wealth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with what hope he, from a foreign land,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was wandering, thus attended; who, in scorn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Answered him nothing; till “Away with him!</div>
      <div class='line'>Bind him there on the house-top, that the moon</div>
      <div class='line'>Shed curses on his face, pale as her own,</div>
      <div class='line'>And our strong Sun burn up his alien blood;</div>
      <div class='line'>And straitly search, and bring me all his gold.”</div>
      <div class='line in4'>They laid him on a low, unfurnished couch,</div>
      <div class='line'>And left him, bound, alone; he could but look</div>
      <div class='line'>Up to the sky, his head so fast was set,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so he lay, and strove to rest himself,</div>
      <div class='line'>But vainly; the sharp cords entered his flesh,</div>
      <div class='line'>The dews sank on his shuddering skin; the Moon</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose, like a fire, among the mango boughs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, slowly wending on her westward way,</div>
      <div class='line'>Smote him with deadly influence: so night passed,</div>
      <div class='line'>A night as long as three; the chilly dawn</div>
      <div class='line'>Came, grey, and weakly struggling with the Moon,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then threw a red flush over all the East,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whereat the Moon turned white, and hid herself,</div>
      <div class='line'>While the great Orb that is her lord arose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And swiftly mounted high: his pain increased,</div>
      <div class='line'>His body streamed, his brain was agonised,</div>
      <div class='line'>His sense was reeling; suddenly there came</div>
      <div class='line'>A tingling stillness on his ears; his eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Closed; and he scarcely knew of one who said,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Let be; unbind him; ’tis a warrior good.”</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Long days the fever lasted, but his strength,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nursed by the breezes of a hardier clime,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would not desert him; so that he arose,</div>
      <div class='line'>A bold, refreshed young giant: then the Chief</div>
      <div class='line'>Spoke soothing words; and Michael hid his wrath,</div>
      <div class='line'>And answered calmly; till they made them terms,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Michael gave the service of his skill</div>
      <div class='line'>To tame those wild Mahrattas, ruling them</div>
      <div class='line'>To discipline, that they might grow more fierce,</div>

      <div class='line'>A happy child of Fortune; yet there burned</div>
      <div class='line'>Two unextinguished furnaces of woe</div>

      <div class='line'>Even when it dealt destruction, gave him joy:</div>

      <div class='line'>Within, the congregated insect life</div>
      <div class='line'>Monotonously hummed; he made two turns,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, calling for his torch, took an old book,</div>
      <div class='line'>Brass-bound and weather wasted, the last gift</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a dear mother, given to him with sobs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And murmured blessings, when he left his home.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>He opened it, and face to face arose</div>
      <div class='line'>The dead old years he thought to have escaped,</div>
      <div class='line'>All chronicled in letters; there he saw</div>
      <div class='line'>Answers to some of his, containing doubts</div>
      <div class='line'>Long since become negations, some again</div>
      <div class='line'>Encouraging resolves of his, long broke,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as he thought, forgotten; not a leaf</div>
      <div class='line'>But marked some downward step: Oh, in our life</div>
      <div class='line'>There are no hours so full of speechless woe,</div>
      <div class='line'>As those in which we read, through misty eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Letters from those who loved us once; of whom</div>
      <div class='line'>Some have long ceased to love at all; the hand</div>

      <div class='line'>That sound the coldest cannot hear unmoved,</div>

      <div class='line'>Had taken form, to ripen into deeds.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The rains were ended; and the army met</div>
      <div class='line'>In an old city where he marshalled them;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as he walked at evening, on the terrace</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the high castle where his dwelling was,</div>
      <div class='line'>He looked through fretted arches to the plain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And saw their tents dropped white and countless there,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like sheep without a shepherd—like poor sheep</div>
      <div class='line'>Marked for the slaughter—and he pitied them.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Ere long, the dying despot of the day</div>
      <div class='line'>Sank softly down, drowned in a sea of blood—</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the old Roman Wolf in Capreæ.</div>
      <div class='line'>Michael prepared for action: dark night fell,</div>
      <div class='line'>The tents were lost to sight, the shouting sank,</div>
      <div class='line'>The drums were silent, all the plain was dark;</div>
      <div class='line'>Only against the far horizon loomed</div>
      <div class='line'>The uneven outline of the distant hills.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>He called his trusty troopers, and stole forth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hoping to pass the camp all unobserved;</div>
      <div class='line'>But with that Host was one who loved him not,</div>
      <div class='line'>His own Lieutenant, nephew to the King,</div>
      <div class='line'>And higher in the soldiers’ hearts than he—</div>
      <div class='line'>This man had dogged his path for many a day—</div>
      <div class='line'>And when they came to the town’s outer gate,</div>
      <div class='line'>They found it strictly guarded; Michael rode,</div>
      <div class='line'>In anger, at the densest, shouting loud,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Smite, smite them, spare not, each man for his life.”</div>
      <div class='line'>His Arab Horse, that stood with gathered limbs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And head reined to his chest, sprang at the cry,</div>
      <div class='line'>And leaping, like a flame, plunged in the crowd;</div>
      <div class='line'>The rest was one confusion, without sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or sound—a breathless dream of ecstasy—</div>
      <div class='line'>Till he, and half a hundred mounted men,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were pouring o’er the plain, as pour the floods,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the dams burst, and winter drowns the fields.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>On came the fierce Lieutenant, and behind</div>
      <div class='line'>Thundered a motley rabble, whose lean steeds</div>
      <div class='line'>Could ill sustain that violent career,</div>
      <div class='line'>And soon there were not left who followed him</div>
      <div class='line'>Five hundred horsemen; still the chase was hot;—</div>

      <div class='line'>And open cornfields, till the spent pursuers</div>
      <div class='line'>Began to drop behind;—some, rolled on earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Saw their girths broken, or their horses slain.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Michael’s men drew bridle and stood still,</div>
      <div class='line'>Waiting the onset of the exhausted crew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose numbers now were scarce the double of theirs.</div>
      <div class='line'>First came the bold Foujdar. “Forward!” he cried;</div>

      <div class='line'>A pistol flash, a groan, a drop of blood</div>
      <div class='line'>On the white drapery he wore—his horse</div>
      <div class='line'>Was riderless for ever. Michael turned</div>
      <div class='line'>Fierce on the cowed pursuers, “Get you back,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tell your master he is now to pay</div>
      <div class='line'>My long-held forfeit for foul injuries,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who dared to fling on me, when I was weak,</div>
      <div class='line'>The childish insults of a childish mind.”</div>
      <div class='line in4'>That night he was within the British lines;</div>
      <div class='line'>But his dear gold was gone; for at the gate</div>
      <div class='line'>His waggon-bullocks and their driver slain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And half his guard cut off, he had but saved</div>
      <div class='line'>His life alone, and some few jewels, stored</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon his person: once more, all his toil,</div>

      <div class='line'>But a sense that all was lost for evermore,</div>
      <div class='line'>That this was now, and worse might be to come,</div>
      <div class='line'>Made the stagnation misery; till, behold,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sad and silent years wore on;—at length</div>
      <div class='line'>His musing Spirit said within herself:—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Oh! for one breath of life; a day, an hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>Before the irrevocable change;—how great</div>

      <div class='line'>Or whether, on some calm Pacific night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where on the farthest limits of the dark</div>
      <div class='line'>There rose and fell the momentary flash</div>
      <div class='line'>Of lone inland volcanoes, some soft breeze</div>
      <div class='line'>Had run her slowly on the coral reefs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the blue waves had rippled o’er her grave,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>There was a nine days’ wonder;—men inquired,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where was the man, whose wealth, without an heir,</div>
      <div class='line'>(So lost, so wonderfully won again,</div>
      <div class='line'>After he left the country, by the faith</div>
      <div class='line'>Of an old servant, thought to have been slain,)</div>

      <div class='line'>There was a Will; all he might have was left</div>
      <div class='line'>To strangers—“to a Lady he had loved.”</div>
      <div class='line in4'>It was the year that filled the century</div>
      <div class='line'>From Michael’s birth, when he was seen again.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>A venturous band had wandered in the West,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till far from towns, or any haunt of men,</div>
      <div class='line'>They came upon a region by the sea.</div>
      <div class='line'>Rock-bound and bare it lay; and all the storms</div>
      <div class='line'>That hurled the ancient, white-topped, weary waves</div>
      <div class='line'>On California, since the world began,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had, day by day, and year by untold year,</div>
      <div class='line'>Heaped all their violence on its patient side,</div>

      <div class='line'>Such dwarf and barren trees as the keen air</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave sufferance to, but rendered still more grim</div>
      <div class='line'>The stony desolation of the place.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Yet was that soil not barren, or the men</div>
      <div class='line'>Had never sought its distant boundaries;</div>
      <div class='line'>For they were of the eager Saxon race,</div>
      <div class='line'>And e’en their rude and weather-wasted garb</div>

      <div class='line in4'>They parted: in the evening, when they met,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their leader wore a sad and solemn look,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with few words he led them up the rocks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Into a stern wild scene. Far as they looked,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cliff heaped on cliff, and stone on fragment stone,</div>
      <div class='line'>The land’s brown ribs extended: here and there</div>
      <div class='line'>Steep chasms it had, declining to the sea:—</div>
      <div class='line'>Some were the beds of streams, that evermore</div>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE VINEYARDS OF BORDEAUX.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c008'><sup>[32]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is no easy matter now-a-days, for
a tourist, whether he travels for pleasure,
health, or information, to throw
his notes and memoranda into such a
shape as shall excite the interest of
the reading public. Nothing new is
to be picked up by traversing the
beaten highways of Europe. We
know all about Madrid, and Stockholm,
and St Petersburg, and Vienna,
and Rome, and Naples. Not only
the banks of the Danube and the
Rhine, but the coasts of Brittany and
the fiords of Norway have been deflowered
of all their legends. There
exists not as much virgin romance in
this quarter of the globe as would
furnish a decent excuse for the perpetration
of three octavo volumes.
Then, as to observations upon men
and manners—a line which earnest-minded
travellers, who have an eye to
the regeneration of the human race,
most commonly adopt—we shall fairly
confess that we take little interest,
and repose less faith, in their fancied
discoveries. Your regenerator is almost
invariably an ass;—ignorant, garrulous,
and as easy to be gulled as the
last convert to the Papacy. At every
<i><span lang="fr">table d’hôte</span></i> he makes a violent effort
to increase his stores of knowledge by
inveigling his nearest neighbour into
a discussion upon some point of grand
social importance; and, in nine cases
out of ten, the result is, that he has
to pay for the whole of the liquor
consumed, without being any wiser
than before. And yet, perhaps, even
the travelling regenerator is less liable
to be humbugged than the travelling
collector of statistics. The most
truthful people in the world neither
think it necessary nor expedient to
speak the truth regarding themselves.
Individuals are not apt to answer the
queries of a stranger touching the
state of their own particular finances—neither
do men choose to disclose
to foreigners the real nature of their
national relations. We are all in the
habit of fibbing most egregiously,
when the honour, the pride, or the
interest of our country is in any degree
concerned. Why should we
scruple to confess that, on various
occasions, we made statements to
confiding foreigners, under a solemn
pledge of secresy, which, when afterwards
printed—the inevitable fate of
all such confidential statements—have
greatly tended to the renown of this
portion of the United Kingdom? Our
rule has always been to act upon the
principle professed by Caleb Balderstone,
and never to stick at trifles
when the “credit of the family” was
involved. We wholly deny that fictions
of this kind can be classed in the category
of falsehoods. They arise
from a just and honourable estimate
of the value of national diplomacy;
and no one but an arrant idiot would
hesitate to contribute his humble quota
towards the exaltation of his race.</p>

<p class='c010'>What right has a Frenchman or
any other foreigner to inquire what
is going on in the heart of Great
Britain? What business is it of his
how we cultivate our fields, work our
machinery, or clear out the recesses
of our mines? Ten to one the fellow
is no better than a spy; and if so,
it is our bounden duty to mislead
him. But patriotism does not belong
to one nation only. When the
Frenchman or other foreigner beholds
an unmistakable Briton, clad, perhaps,
in the drab uniform of Manchester,
making curious investigations
into the value of his crops, and the
other sources of his wealth, he most
naturally concludes that the child of
perfidious Albion is actuated by some
sinister motive. The result may be
conceived. Figures, more mendacious
than any that were ever promulgated
by the League, are supplied
with amazing liberality to the believing
statist. He calculates the product
of a province, after the inspection
of a single farmyard; commits
his observations to the press, and is
henceforward quoted as an oracle!</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not from tourists that we can
hope to gather accurate information
of the state of other countries. A
very great amount of mischief and
misconception has arisen from an
absurd reliance in the accuracy of
men who were absolute strangers to
the country in which they sojourned,
and necessarily exposed to every sort
of imposition; and really, with all
deference to our brethren of the daily
press, we must be allowed to express
our conviction that the system of
“Commissionership” has, of late
years, been carried a great deal too
far. Of the talents of the gentlemen
so employed we would wish to speak
with the utmost respect. They are,
almost all of them, clever fellows,
sharp, shrewd, and observing; but it
is too much to expect that, at a
moment’s notice, they can forget the
whole previous antecedents of their
lives, and discourse dogmatically and
with perfect precision upon subjects
of which they knew nothing until
they were gazetted for the special
service.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Reach, we trust, will do us
the kindness to believe that these
preliminary remarks have not been
elicited by anything contained in his
present volume, and also that we
intend no insinuation derogatory of
his contributions in the capacity of a
commissioner. The fact is, that we
have not read his papers on the social
and agricultural condition of the peasantry
of France, being somewhat
more deeply interested in the condition
of our peasantry at home; but
we know quite enough of his talent
and ability to make us certain that
he has treated the subject both
honestly and well. Fortunately we
are not called upon now to investigate
his statistical budget. He comes
before us in the more agreeable
character of a traveller in the sunny
south of France. Led by a fine natural
instinct, he has tarried in the
vinous district until he has imbibed
the true spirit of the region. His
native Caledonian sympathies in favour
of claret—a disposition in which we
cordially participate, detesting port
almost as intensely as Whiggery—were
fully developed by a sojourn in
the neighbourhood of the Chateau
Lafitte. Of Ceres, at so much a
quarter, he tells us nothing—of Bacchus,
at so much a bottle, he speaks
well and eloquently. Endowed by
nature with a gay and happy temper,
fond of fun, relishing adventure, and
with a fine eye for the picturesque,
he ranges from the Garonne to the
Rhone, from the shores of the Bay of
Biscay to the Mediterranean marshes,
from the sterile wastes of the Landes,
by the splendour of the Pyrenees, to
the old Roman city of Nismes—making
us wish all the while that we
could have made the journey in such
agreeable company. As a fellow-traveller,
we should be inclined to say
that he errs on the score of haste.
Assuredly we should have lingered
with reverence at some places which
he passed with undue precipitancy.
He had no right to hurry through
Haut-brion as he did—he should have
dwelt longer at Leoville. Our matured
taste and experience of vintages
would have mitigated the rapidity of
his career.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Reach has not done justice to
himself in the selection of a title for
his volume. <cite>Claret and Olives</cite> are
rather apt to be misunderstood in the
present day, owing to the practices
of previous authors, who have been in
the habit of vending the properties
of the deceased Joseph Miller under
some such after-dinner disguise.
<cite>Wine and Walnuts</cite> was an old title,
whereof we have an indistinct recollection;
our impression at this moment
being, that the wine was corked
and the walnuts woefully shrivelled.
Then followed <cite>Nuts and Nutcrackers</cite>—maggoty
enough, and filled with
devil’s-dust that might have choked a
member of the League. <cite>Grog and
Biscuits</cite> we presume to have been a
feeble sort of production, emanating
from a disappointed mind, working
on a heritage of wrong. <cite>Sherry and
Cheroots</cite> did not amalgamate. <cite>Alcohol
and Anchovies</cite> gave token of a
diseased intellect and a ruined constitution.
<cite>Tumblers and Talk</cite>—a
Glasgow publication, if we recollect
aright—had little circulation except
among bibulous members of town-councils,
or similar corporations.
<cite>Ale and Æsthetics</cite> was but an unfortunate
specimen of alliteration. How
many editions of <cite>Beer and ‘Baccy</cite> have
been printed, we know not; but we
are not aware as yet that the author
has made his fortune. With all these
beacons before him, we could wish
that Mr Reach had announced his
book under some other name. He is
not to be confounded, as an author,
with the issuers of such catch-pennies.
Putting aside even his present work
as one of limited interest—though we
should be puzzled to name any tourist
who writes more pleasantly than our
author—his novel of <cite>Leonard Lindsay</cite>
displays a carefulness of composition,
and a life-like painting, in the style of
Defoe, which contrasts remarkably
with the slip-shod trash now forming
the staple commodity of the circulating
libraries. There is the right stuff
in him, visible throughout whatever
he attempts; and if at times his taste
is liable to exception, we believe that
aberration to be solely owing to the
exigencies of the times, which leave
far too little leisure to most men to
revise and consider their productions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The title, however, is unquestionably
appropriate enough, though it
may be calculated to mislead the
reader. In his wanderings he has
visited the home domain both of the
vine and the olive—at least he has
passed from the sanctuary of the one
to the outskirts of the other; but we
could really wish that he had not profaned
the goodly vintage by reminding
us of those lumps of vegetable fatness
which sometimes, even now, are served
up at an octogenarian symposium, in
honour of the goddess Dyspepsia. We
honour oil like the Sultan Saladin,
and could wish to see it brought into
more general use in this country;
but there is something revolting to
us in the sight and colour of the olive,
which has neither the freshness of
youth nor the fine hue of maturity.
The last man whom we remember to
have seen eating olives was an eminent
manufacturer of Staleybridge,
who helped himself to the fruit of
Minerva with his short stubby fingers,
descanting all the while on the propriety
of the enactment of a bill for
augmenting the hours of infant labour.
He died, if we recollect aright, about
a fortnight afterwards—perhaps in
consequence of the olives: if so, we
are not disposed to deny that at times
they may be served up with advantage.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Reach, however, loathes the
olive as much as we do, and therefore
there is no difference of opinion between
us. We like the fine enthusiasm
with which he does justice to
the taste of our mother country—a
taste which we are certain will not
decay so long as Leith flourishes, and
the house of Bell and Rannie continues
to maintain its pristine ascendancy
in claret. With us in the
north, we are glad to say there
is no recognised medium between
Glenlivat and Bordeaux. Either
have in the hot water, or produce
your ’34; nobody will thank you
for that port which you bought last
week at an auction, and which you
are desirous to represent as having
been bottled for your use about
the era of the Reform Bill. It may
be both “curious” and “crusted,”
as you say it is; but you had better
have it set aside to make sauce for
wild-ducks. Indeed, “curious” port
is, for many reasons, a thing to be
avoided. We remember once dining
at the house of an excellent clergyman
in the country, whose palate,
however, might have undergone a
little more cultivation, with mutual
advantage to himself and to his acquaintance.
On that occasion we
were presented three times with a
certain fluid, under three different
names; but all of us afterwards agreed
that it was the same liquor, varying
simply in degree of temperature.
First, it came in smoking in a tureen,
and was then called hare-soup; secondly,
it was poured out cold from a
decanter, under the denomination of
port; third, and lastly, it came before
us tepidly, with the accompaniment
of sugar and cream, and the red-armed
Hebe who brought the tray
had the effrontery to assure us that it
was coffee. So much for the curious
vintage of Oporto—but we are forgetting
Mr Reach.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is really much to the credit of Scotland
that she stood staunchly by her old
ally, France, and would have nothing to
do with that dirty little slice of the worst
part of Spain—Portugal, or her brandified
potations. In the old Scotch houses
a cask of claret stood in the hall, nobly
on the tap. In the humblest Scotch
country tavern, the pewter <i><span lang="sco">tappit-hen</span></i>,
holding some three quarts—think of that,
Master Slender—‘reamed’ (<cite>Anglice</cite>,
mantled) with claret just drawn from the
cask; and you quaffed it, snapping your
fingers at custom-houses. At length, in
an evil hour, Scotland fell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We have more than half a mind
to ascend the Rhine to Bacharach,
and swear upon the altar of Lyæus—which
must now be visible, if the
weather on the Continent has been as
dry as here—never to relax our efforts
until either the Union, or the infamous
duty on the wines of Bordeaux,
is repealed! But we must calm
ourselves and proceed moderately.
Now, then, for the vineyards—here,
as elsewhere, no very picturesque objects
to the eye, but conveying a moral
lesson that real goodness does not
depend upon external appearances.
We never saw a vineyard yet, whereof
the wine was worth drinking, which
a man would care to look at twice.
Your raspberry-bush is, upon the
whole, a statelier plant than the vine
when fulfilling its noblest functions;
nevertheless, we presume there are
few who would give the preference to
raspberry vinegar over veritable Lafitte.
We have seen the vineyards in
spring, when, as poor Ovid says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la">Quoque loco est vitis, de palmite gemma movetur;</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>but they do not bud at all so luxuriantly
as a poet would fancy. The
only time for seeing them to advantage
is at the gathering of the grapes,
when the gay dresses of the vintagers
give animation to the scene, and song
and laughter proclaim the season of
general jubilee. There is nothing in
our northern climates to compare with
it, especially of late years, since the
harvest-home brings no certainty of
added wealth. Just fancy Mr Cobden
at a <i><span lang="gd">kirn</span></i>! Why, at the very
sight of him the twasome reel would
stop of its own accord—the blind old
fiddler, scenting some unholy thing,
would mitigate the ardour of his bow—and
the patriarch of the parish,
brewing punch, would inevitably
drown the miller. Lucky for the intruder
if he made his escape without
being immersed in a tub of sowens!</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall let Mr Reach speak for
himself, as to the complexion of his
favourite vineyards.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fancy open and unfenced expanses
of stunted-looking, scrubby bushes, seldom
rising two feet above the surface,
planted in rows upon the summit of deep
furrow ridges, and fastened with great
care to low fence-like lines of espaliers,
which run in unbroken ranks from one
end of the huge fields to the other.
These espaliers or lathes are cuttings of
the walnut-trees around, and the tendrils
of the vine are attached to the horizontally
running slopes with withes, or
thongs of bark. It is curious to observe
the vigilant pains and attention with
which every twig has been supported
without being trained, and how things
are arranged, so as to give every cluster
as fair a chance as possible of a goodly
allowance of sun. Such, then, is the
general appearance of matters; but it is
by no means perfectly uniform. Now
and then you find a patch of vines unsupported,
drooping, and straggling,
and sprawling, and intertwisting their
branches like beds of snakes; and again,
you come into the district of a new
species of bush, a thicker, stouter affair,
a grenadier vine, growing to at least six
feet, and supported by a corresponding
stake. But the low, two-feet dwarfs are
invariably the great wine-givers. If
ever you want to see a homily, not read,
but grown by nature, against trusting to
appearances, go to Medoc and study the
vines. Walk and gaze, until you come
to the most shabby, stunted, weazened,
scrubby, dwarfish expanse of bushes,
ignominiously bound neck and crop to
the espaliers, like a man on the rack—these
utterly poor, starved, and meagre-looking
growths, allowing, as they do,
the gravelly soil to show in bald patches
of grey shingle through the straggling
branches,—these contemptible-looking
shrubs, like paralysed and withered raspberries,
it is which produce the most priceless,
and the most inimitably-flavoured
wines. Such are the vines that grow
Chateau Margaux at half-a-sovereign the
bottle. The grapes themselves are equally
unpromising. If you saw a bunch in
Covent Garden, you would turn from them
with the notion that the fruiterer was
trying to do his customer with over-ripe
black currants. Lance’s soul would take
no joy in them, and no sculptor in his
senses would place such meagre bunches
in the hands and over the open mouths of
his Nymphs, his Bacchantes, or his
Fauns. Take heed, then, by the lesson,
and beware of judging of the nature of
either men or grapes by their looks.
Meantime, let us continue our survey of
the country. No fences or ditches you
see—the ground is too precious to be lost
in such vanities—only, you observe from
time to time a rudely curved stake stuck
in the ground, and indicating the limits
of properties. Along either side of the
road the vines extend, utterly unprotected.
No raspers, no ha-ha’s, no fierce
denunciations of trespassers, no polite
notices of spring-guns and steel-traps
constantly in a state of high-go-offism—only,
where the grapes are ripening, the
people lay prickly branches along the
wayside to keep the dogs, foraging for
partridges among the espaliers, from taking
a refreshing mouthful from the clusters
as they pass; for it seems to be a
fact, that everybody, every beast, and
every bird, whatever may be his, her, or its
nature in other parts of the world, when
brought amongst grapes, eats grapes. As
for the peasants, their appetite for grapes
is perfectly preposterous. Unlike the surfeit-sickened
grocer’s boys, who, after the
first week, loathe figs, and turn poorly
whenever sugar candy is hinted at, the
love of grapes appears literally to grow
by what it feeds on. Every garden is
full of table vines. The people eat grapes
with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and supper.
The labourer plods along the road munching
a cluster. The child in its mother’s
arms is lugging away with its toothless
gums at a bleeding bunch; while, as for
the vintagers, male and female, in the less
important plantations, heaven only knows
where the masses of grapes go to, which
they devour, labouring incessantly at
the <em>metier</em>, as they do, from dawn till
sunset.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In all this, however, we cannot say
that we detect any matter for surprise.
The grape season lasts only
for a short period; and we have observed
symptoms of a similarly universal
appetite in this country when
gooseberries are at their perfection.
Nay, we shall venture to say that Mr
Reach himself would cut no indifferent
figure in a garden where the honeyblobs,
hairy-yellows, and bloody-captains
were abundant. As for the
consumption by the vintagers and
pressmen, that can be accounted for
on the same principle which forbids
the muzzling of the ox while treading
out the corn; but we never enter
willingly into such details, being satisfied
that, with regard to many things
edible, potable, and culinary, it is
imprudent to be too curious in investigation.
We eat and drink in confidence,
as our fathers did before us,
trusting that what harmed not them
can do us no manner of injury; and
we do not feel at all grateful to those
gentlemen who think it necessary to
go out of their way for the purpose of
presenting as with detailed accounts
of the minutiæ of the vinous manufacture.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is, we think, a peculiar feature
of the wines of the Bordelais, that
you will rarely, if ever, find a connoisseur
who will confess an undivided
and exclusive attachment to any one
particular growth. We fear that the
claret-drinker has much of the libertine
in his disposition. He flits from
vineyard to vineyard, without being
able to fix his affections once and for
ever. Such pleasant fickleness is not
akin to the downright English spirit,
and therefore perhaps it is that Englishmen
generally prefer the heavy
Portuguese drench, to the lively Gallican
nectar. In London it is not
uncommon to hear a man swearing by
Barclay and Perkins, in almost feudal
opposition to Meux. Many would
rather be tee-totallers than defile their
throats with other beer than that of
Hanbury; and the partisans of Bass
stand in deadly opposition to those
who espouse the cause of Allsopp.
So on the Rhine, men are bigoted to
their vineyards. One individual
approaches you, as Uhland beautifully
remarks in the best of his romantic
ballads,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“With a flask of Asmannshauser</div>
      <div class='line'>In each pocket of his trowser,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and vows, by the memory of Herrmann,
and by that of Brennus, who
first brought the vine from Italy, that
the red fluid is incomparably superior
to the pale. With a scornful laugh
the adherent of Steinberger listens to
the boast, and pours into his glass a
beverage which scents the room like
a dozen nosegays. A fiery devotee of
Neiersteiner stands up—or rather tries
to do so, if he is deep in his third
bottle—for the credit of his pet vintage;
and a priest, addicted to Liebfrauen-milch,
in vain attempts to end
the controversy by descanting upon
the sanctity of his liquor. In Nuremberg
we have witnessed several serious
rows on the subject of the superiority
of beer. A hot contest had
been going on for some time as to the
merits of the respective browsts of
“right Bavarian” at the Himmelsleiter
and the Jammer-thal, the two
most considerable beer-taverns in
Germany; until at last—this was in
’48—we of the Himmelsleiter being
no longer able to stand the <em>outrecuidance</em>
of our opponents, who were
notoriously of the democratic party,
marched upon them, and, under cover
of political principle, smashed the
glasses, and set several casks of the
obnoxious fluid abroach. This is bare
matter of fact; but if any gentleman
is sceptical as to the possibility of
such a movement, we may as well
remind him that the only serious rising
which took place in Bavaria originated
from a proposed impost of an
infinitesimal duty upon beer. Were
England as Bavaria is, the continuance
of the malt-tax would have led
to a crisis of the most alarming description—and,
after all, we cannot
help thinking that the name of Hampden
would now have been held in
higher estimation, had he stood forward
in the cause of his country’s
beer, instead of being the opponent of
a miserable tax, which weighed only
upon men of his own condition.</p>

<p class='c010'>But we must not become political.
So, gentlemen, “the memory of
Hampden” in any kind of beer you
choose, from the smallest to the stiffest;—and
now to our present subject.
We are very sorry indeed to observe
that the taste in champagne—a wine
which we hold in much reverence—is
becoming hideously depraved in this
country. We do not speak merely
of England—England can look
after herself, and Cyrus Redding is a
safe monitor on such subjects, who,
we trust, will make strong head
against national depreciation. Sparkling
Hock and petillating Moselle may
be tolerated, though we do not like
them; and we have no objection to
St Peray as an agreeable companion
to a cutlet. But, latterly, some superlative
trash has made its appearance
among us under such names as the
Ruby and the Garnet; and we would
earnestly recommend all good Christians
who have a regard for their
stomachs to avoid these. The fact is,
that there is no tolerable medium in
the quality of the wines of Champagne.
Either they are first-rate,
in order to secure which you had
best stick to the established names,
or they are not one whit preferable
to Perry. A conservative taste in
wines is likely to be the most correct.
Adhere to the ancient vineyards, and
have nothing to do with newfangled
fluids, however puffed or recommended.
If you want to know how
these are made, listen to Mr Reach,
whose fine palate enabled him at once
to detect the slightest touch of adulteration.
Young men are apt to be
led astray by the splendour of novel
names, and to believe in the possibility
of the discovery of new vineyards.
They cannot resist an imposition, if it
is paraded before them with proper
pomp and dignity. Some years ago
a nondescript species of liquor, bad
enough to perpetuate the cholera in a
province, was received with considerable
approbation, because it bore the
high-sounding name of “Œil de Montmorenci.”
We always distrust in
wines those poetical and chivalresque
titles. From this condemnation, however,
we would specially exclude
“Beaujolais de Fleury,” a delicious
liquor, which might have beseemed
the cup of old King Réné of Provence.
But your Œil de Montmorencis,
your Chateau Chastelheraults,
and your Sang de St Simeons, with
other similar ptisans, are neither
more nor less than the concoction of
those ingenious troubadours, the wine-fabricators
of Cette.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I said that it was good—good for
our stomachs—to see no English bunting
at Cette. The reason is, that Cette is a
great manufacturing place, and that what
they manufacture there is neither cotton
nor wool, Perigord pies nor Rheims biscuits,
but wine. ‘<i><span lang="fr">Içi</span></i>,’ will a Cette industrial
write with the greatest coolness
over his Porte Cochère—‘<i><span lang="fr">Içi on fabrique
des vins.</span></i>’ All the wines in the world,
indeed, are made in Cette. You have
only to give an order for Johannisberg
or Tokay—nay, for all I know, for the
Falernian of the Romans, or the nectar
of the gods—and the Cette manufacturers
will promptly supply you. They are
great chemists, these gentlemen, and
have brought the noble art of adulteration
to a perfection which would make
our own mere logwood and sloe-juice
practitioners pale and wan with envy.
But the great trade of the place is not so
much adulterating as concocting wine.
Cette is well situated for this notable
manufacture. The wines of southern
Spain are brought by coasters from Barcelona
and Valencia. The inferior Bordeaux
growths come pouring from the
Garonne by the Canal du Midi; and the
hot and fiery Rhone wines are floated
along the chain of etangs and canals from
Beaucaire. With all these raw materials,
and, of course, a chemical laboratory to
boot, it would be hard if the clever folks
of Cette could not turn out a very good
imitation of any wine in demand. They
will doctor you up bad Bordeaux with
violet powders and rough cider—colour
it with cochineal and turnsole, and outswear
creation that it is precious Chateau
Margaux, vintage of ’25. Champagne,
of course, they make by hogsheads. Do
you wish sweet liqueur wines from Italy
and the Levant? The Cette people will
mingle old Rhone wines with boiled
sweet wines from the neighbourhood of
Lunel, and charge you any price per
bottle. Port, sherry, and Madeira, of
course, are fabricated in abundance with
any sort of bad, cheap wine and brandy,
for a stock, and with half the concoctions
in a druggist’s shop for seasoning. Cette,
in fact, is the very capital and emporium
of the tricks and rascalities of the wine-trade;
and it supplies almost all the Brazils,
and a great proportion of the northern
European nations, with their after-dinner
drinks. To the grateful Yankees
it sends out thousands of tons of Ay and
Moet; besides no end of Johannisberg,
Hermitage, and Chateau Margaux—the
fine qualities and dainty aroma of which
are highly prized by the Transatlantic amateurs.
The Dutch flag fluttered plentifully
in the harbour, so that I presume Mynheer
is a customer to the Cette industrials—or,
at all events, he helps in the distribution
of their wares. The old French
West Indian colonies also patronise their
ingenious countrymen of Cette; and
Russian magnates get drunk on Chambertin
and Romanee Conte, made of low
Rhone and low Burgundy brewages,
eked out by the contents of the graduated
vial. I fear, however, that we do come
in—in the matter of ‘fine golden sherries,
at 22s. 9½d. a dozen,’ or ‘peculiar old-crusted
port, at 1s. 9d.’—for a share of
the Cette manufactures; and it is very
probable that after the wine is fabricated
upon the shores of the Mediterranean, it
is still further improved upon the banks
of the Thames.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We wish that these remarks could be
made practically useful to that class
of men who give dinners, and gabble
about their wines. Nothing is, to our
mind, more disgusting than the conduct
of an Amphytrion who accompanies
the introduction of each bottle
by an apocryphal averment as to its
age, coupled with a minute account of
the manner in which it came into his
possession—he having, in nine cases
out of ten, purchased it at a sale.
Sometimes the man goes further, and
volunteers a statement of its price.
Now this is, to say the very least of
it, a mark of the worst possible breeding.
No guest, with a palate to his
mouth, will relish the wine any better,
because the ninny-hammer who gives
it declares that it cost him seven
guineas a dozen. We don’t want to
know from an entertainer, unless he
be a tavern-keeper, the absolute cost
of his victuals. Just fancy Lucullus,
in the saloon of Apollo, recounting the
items of his repast—“Flaccus, my
friend, those oysters which you are
devouring with so much gusto cost
ten sestertii a-piece. Fabius, my fine
fellow, that dish of thrushes which
you have just swallowed was not got
for nothing—it cost me a whole sestertium.
Peg away, Plancus, at the
lampreys! May Pluto seize me if a
dozen of them are not worth a tribune’s
salary. You like the Falernian,
Furius? Ay—that’s right Anno
Urbis 521—I bought it at Sylla’s sale.
It just cost me its weight in silver.
Davus, you dog! bring another
amphora with the red seal—the same
that we got from the cellars of Mithridates.
Here’s that, O conscript
fathers, which will make the cockles
of your hearts rejoice!” Now, who
will tell us that such conversation,
which would be revolting even from a
Lucullus, ought to be tolerated from
the lips of some pert whippersnapper,
who, ten years ago, would have been
thankful for a bumper of Bucellas after
a repast upon fried liver? We are
serious in saying that it is full time to
put a stop to such a nuisance, which
is more common than many people
would believe; and perhaps the easiest
way of doing so is by doggedly maintaining
that each bottle is corked.
After half-a-dozen of the famous vintage
have been opened, and pronounced
undrinkable, the odds are that you
will hear nothing more for the rest of
the evening on the subject of liquor.
Your suggestion as to a tumbler will
be received with grateful humility, and
thus you will not only receive the
applause of your fellow-guests, but
the approbation of your own stomach
and conscience, both then and on the
following morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are many points connected
with dinner-giving—dinner-taking
belonging to a different branch of
ethics—which deserve mature consideration.
If you are not a man of
large fortune, you must perforce
study economy. We presume that you
have in your cellar a certain limited
portion of really good wine, such as
will make glad the heart of man, and
leave no vestige of a headache; but
you cannot afford, and you certainly
ought not to bestow, that indiscriminately.
Good taste in wine is, like
good taste in pictures, and good taste
in poetry, by no means a common
gift. Every man wishes to be thought
to possess it; but, in reality, the
number of those who have the gift of
the “geschmack,” as the Germans
term the faculty, is but few. Now it
would evidently be the height of extravagance
were you to throw away
first-rate wine upon men who cannot
appreciate it. Who, in the possession
of his senses, would dream of
feeding pigs on pine-apples? And
as, in this wicked world, we are all
of us occasionally compelled to give
dinners to men, who, though excellent
creatures in other respects, are
utterly deficient in the finer sensations
of our being, we cannot, for the
life of us, see why they should be
treated contrary to the bent of their
organisation. Give them toddy, and
they are supremely happy. Why
place before them Lafitte, which they
are sure to swallow in total ignorance
of its qualities, very likely commending
it as good “fresh claret,”
and expressing their opinion that
such wine is better from the wood
than the bottle? Keep your real
good liquor for such men as are
capable of understanding it. There
is no higher treat than to form one
of a party of six, all people of
first-rate intelligence, true, generous,
clarety souls, when the best of the
vintages of Bordeaux is circulating
at the board. No man talks of the
wine—he would as soon think of
commending the air because it was
wholesome, or the sun because it
gave him warmth. They drink it
with a quiet gusto and silent enjoyment,
which prove that it is just the
thing; and no impertinent remonstrance
is made when the bell is
pulled, until taste, which your true
claret-drinker never disobeys, simultaneously
indicates to the party that
they have had a proper allowance.
Indeed, you will almost never find a
thorough gentleman, who has been
properly educated in claret, committing
any excess. Port sends people
to the drawing-room with flushed
faces, husky voices, and staring eyes,
bearing evident marks upon them of
having partaken of the cup of Circe.
Claret merely fosters the kindlier
qualities, and brings out in strong
relief the attributes of the gentleman
and the scholar.</p>

<p class='c010'>We should have liked, had time
permitted, to have transcribed one or
two of Mr Reach’s sketches of scenery,
especially his description of the
Landes, where, instead of wine, men
gather a harvest of resin, and where
the shepherds imitate the crane, by
walking perpetually upon stilts. We
already possessed some knowledge of
that singular region from the writings
of George Sand, but Mr Reach’s
description is more simple, and certainly
more easily realised. His
account also of Pau, and its society,
and the neighbouring scenery, is remarkably
good; but so is the book
generally, and therefore we need not
particularise. Only, as we are bound
to discharge the critical function with
impartiality, and as we are rather in
a severe mood, this not being one of
our claret days, we take leave to say
that the legends which he has engrafted
are by far the least valuable
portion of the volume. Everybody
who knows anything of modern bookmaking,
must be aware that such
tales are entirely attributable to the
fertile genius of the author; for we
would as soon believe in the discovery
of a buried treasure, as in the
existence of those grey-haired guides,
veteran smugglers, and antique boatmen,
who are invariably brought forward
as the Homeridæ or recounters
of floating tradition. We have travelled
a good deal in different parts of
the world, and seen as much of that
kind of society as our neighbours; but
we can safely aver that we never yet
met with a local Sinbad who had anything
to tell worth the hearing. If
an author wants the materials of
romance, the best place that he can
frequent is a commercial traveller’s
room. We have been privileged to
hear in such social circles more marvels
than would furnish forth a whole
library of romance, with this additional
advantage, that the narrator of
the tale, whether it referred to love or
war, was invariably its principal hero.</p>

<p class='c010'>But we are now rapidly approaching
the limits of our paper, and must
break off. Those who have a mind
to know something of the south of
France—of that strange old place,
Aigues-Mortes, from which the Crusaders
once embarked for Palestine,
but which is now almost entirely deserted,
and left like a mouldering
wreck in the midst of the marshes
that surround it—of Nismes, with its
remains of Roman greatness and
power—and of Languedoc, the name
of which province is more inspiring
than its actual appearance—will do
well to consult this lively and agreeable
volume. But beyond the district
of the vine we are determined not to
journey now. Fair, we doubt not,
are the vineyards in this beautiful
spring—fair, at least, in the eye of
the poet who believes in the promise
of their buds. With us the lilacs and
the laburnums are scarce yet expanding
their blossoms; but it is a beautiful
and a consoling thought that,
within the circle of Bordeaux, thousands
and thousands of vines are just
now bursting into blossom, to alleviate
the toils and cheer the hearts of
the claret-drinkers of this and perchance
of the next generation. May
the year be ever famous in the annals
of legitimate thirst! And with this
devout aspiration, which we doubt
not will be echoed by many good fellows
and true, we take our leave of
Mr Reach, thanking him for the
amusement and information we have
derived from the perusal of his pleasant
book.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE DEMOCRATIC CONFEDERACY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Although the precise period for
the dissolution of Parliament is not
yet known, we hear, on every side, the
hum of political preparation. Members
who had confidently reckoned on
a longer lease of their seats, are trying
to reconcile past votes with the present
temper of their constituents, and,
where they cannot openly vindicate
their conduct, suggesting pleas in
palliation. The over-timorous, and
those who feel that they have no
longer a chance of office, are issuing
valedictory addresses, expressive of
their preference of private life to the
turmoil of a public career. Some are
recanting former professions—others
becoming bolder and more determined
in their views. It is natural that
such should be the case. The contest
is not now solely between Whig and
Tory, or even between Free-Trader
and Protectionist. It has, owing to
the occurrences of the last few months,
assumed a more portentous aspect.
Since his resignation, if we may not
assume an earlier date, Lord John
Russell has entered into the most close
and intimate relations with the Manchester
party, whose confession of
political faith, as they themselves
hardly scruple to avow, falls very
little short of Republicanism. No
sooner was he in opposition than he
hastened to take counsel with Mr
Cobden. The triumvirate was completed
by the adhesion of Sir James
Graham, a man who, having exhausted
every possible form of moderate
opinion, having played more parts in
his day than the imagination of Autolycus
could conceive, has assumed in
his advanced years the character of
an uncompromising democrat. Under
Lord John Russell, Whiggery had
lost its power. He could no longer
command the suffrages, because he
did not avow the opinions of the
fiercer Liberal party, and because, so
long as he remained allied with and
recognised by the Whig aristocracy,
he could not conciliate the chiefs and
leaders of the democracy. He did
not even understand the traditions of
his own party—at all events, he has
forgotten them for wellnigh twenty
years. However much the Whigs,
in former times, may, for their own
purposes, have appeared to tamper
with the Constitution, they were at
least understood to be in nowise the
advocates of what is now called perpetual
progress. They were not constantly
innovating, for innovation’s
sake—or altering for the sake of securing
a little temporary popularity.
But Lord John Russell can no more
abstain from experiment than a
chemical lecturer. Partly from natural
propensity, and partly from political
exigencies, which he considered
himself compelled to meet adroitly,
in order to defeat his chief political
antagonist, he walked on, step by
step, until he reached the boundary of
Radicalism. Once there, the temptation
to venture over was great. His
own immediate followers were few
and feeble; behind him was the Conservative
phalanx,—firm, united, and
powerful; before him was the <em>Garde
Mobile</em> of the Destructives, eagerly
beckoning him over. He went; and
it is little wonder if those of his staff
who disapproved of so desperate a
course, should now be either retiring
from the field, or wandering about in
disguise. What line, indeed, can a
Ministerial Whig, who purposes to
take his seat in the next Parliament,
adopt with regard to his constituents?
If he should say that he has faith and
confidence in Lord John Russell, he
must equally declare that he has faith
and confidence in Mr Cobden, for
these two are now inseparable in
virtue of their late alliance. And if
he is prepared to support a Cobden
Ministry, he must needs avow himself
a democrat. If, on the other hand,
he should denounce Lord John Russell,
and deny his leadership, whom
is he prepared to follow? Is he to
oppose Lord Derby as a Conservative,
when the only possible party that can
succeed to office in the event of the
defeat of Lord Derby is that of the
Destructives? Who leads him? Under
what particular banner does he
now profess to serve? These are
questions and considerations which,
during the last two months, have engrossed
the attention of many a hesitating
Whig, and which are now
agitating, with great force, the whole
of the electoral community. For it is
quite clear that the old Whig party
has ceased to have a separate existence.
We do not say that, in time
coming, it may not be reconstructed.
There are materials enough to do
that, providing a fitting architect can
be found; but in the absence of any
such artist, it must necessarily remain
in abeyance. Men of moderate
opinions—such as Sir William Gibson
Craig, whose high character, affable
demeanour, and unwearied attention
to the interests of his constituents
rendered his re-election perfectly
secure—decline to present themselves
as candidates at the approaching
general election. Making every
allowance for special and private
reasons, on which no one has a right
to comment, it does appear to us that
such instances of withdrawal argue
great uncertainty as to the political
future, and cannot in any way be
construed into tokens of approval of
that line of conduct which Lord John
Russell has thought fit to adopt. We
could very well understand such withdrawals
from public life, were the late
Premier still in power. We can hardly
believe that they would have taken
place, had he remained, in adversity,
the exponent and representative of
the views which have hitherto been
held by gentlemen of the old Whig
party. Our own conviction is, that
his conduct, since he was compelled
to surrender power, has alienated the
confidence of the best and wisest of
his former adherents, who regarded
his proposed Reform Bill with marked
apprehension, and were sincerely rejoiced
to be freed from the responsibility
which must have attached to
all, who, from party ties, might have
thought themselves obliged to vote
for so very dangerous a measure. It
is now well known that the leading
Whigs of England regard the defeat
of Lord John Russell rather as a deliverance
than a calamity. Henceforward
they have done with him.
If he is again to take office, he cannot
count upon his old supporters. The
Whig peers—the Lansdownes, the
Fitzwilliams, the Zetlands—are too
sensible, honourable, and loyal to
support a Cabinet in which Mr Cobden
must have the principal say; and
throughout the country we know that
public opinion among the educated
classes is utterly opposed to, and abhorrent
of any such consummation.
The few Whigs who are struggling
to attain or regain their contested
seats, dare not venture upon a distinct
enunciation of their own opinions.
They usually have recourse to such
general terms as—“wise and temperate
reform;”—“that degree of
progress which the advanced position
and increased intelligence of the age
render imperative;”—or, “the timely
concession to popular demand of those
privileges which, if withheld, may
hereafter be more clamorously enforced.”
It is no use commenting upon
such language. The unhappy individuals
who employ it are quite guiltless
of any meaning; and they could
not explain themselves if required.
Generally speaking, they cut a most
miserable figure when under examination
by some burly Radical. On no
one point are they explicit, save in
their rejection of the ballot, which
they think themselves entitled to except
to, as Lord John Russell has
hitherto declined to pronounce in favour
of secret voting; and they dare
not, for the lives of them, attempt to
mark out the limit of the suffrage, or
state the proper period for the duration
of Parliaments. This is but a
cowardly and contemptible line of
conduct. If they have any spark of
manhood in them, why can they not
speak out? Surely by this time they
should know the points of the Charter
by heart, and be able to tell the constituencies
to which of them they are
ready to agree. On the contrary, we
find nothing but dodging, shuffling,
equivocating, and reserving. The fact
is, that they have no mind of their
own at all, and they are in sore perplexity
as to the state of two other
minds which they are trying to reconcile—the
first being the mind of Lord
John Russell, and the second being
the mind of the constituency which
they are addressing. For, apart from
reform altogether, there are several
topics about which your pure Whig
candidate must be exceedingly cautious.
For example, there is the withdrawal
of the grant to Maynooth.
Even supposing that Lord John Russell
were as alert a Protestant as he
professed himself to be in the autumn
of 1850, how could he venture to sacrifice
the support of the Irish tail?
Therein lies the difficulty. You will
find plenty of men—very determined
Protestants, but also very determined
adherents of the late Ministry—who
will tell you “that they were always
opposed to any grant of the kind;”—that
is, that they thought it essentially
wrong, not only in a political,
but in a religious point of view; but,
press one of these gentlemen upon the
point, especially if, as in the case of
Edinburgh, the selection of a candidate
seems to depend greatly on his
views with regard to that measure,
and you will almost invariably find
that his attachment to Protestantism
is less strong than his regard for the
interests of his party. This may not
be right, and we do not think it is so;
but we infinitely prefer the conduct
and avowal of such men to the disgraceful
exhibitions which have lately
been made by more than one Whig
candidate. Opinions, based on religious
principle, never ought to be
conceded. Changed they may be;
but what idea of the sincerity of such
a change can be formed, when we find
it taking place immediately on the
eve of an election, and, in one instance,
after the issue of an address?
After all, we are perhaps too severe.
Every one knows what was the miserable
denouement of Lord John Russell’s
determined stand for Protestantism
against Papal aggression; and it
might be too much to expect that the
devoted and even servile follower
should exhibit, in his own person,
more consistency than was displayed
by his redoubted chief.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is, however, quite apparent that,
notwithstanding Lord John Russell’s
advances to the Radical party, the
latter are by no means inclined to place
confidence in the Whigs. In every
case in which such a movement seems
likely to be attended with any prospect
of success, they are putting forward
candidates of their own—men
whose adhesion to democratic principles
is beyond the possibility of a
challenge. Persons whose names were
never before heard of—utterly briefless
barristers, reporters and writers
for the Radical press, broken-down
speculators, who consider a career
within the walls of St Stephen’s as
the best method of effacing the memory
of the enormities of Capel Court,
attorneys in dubious practice, and the
like class of characters—are presenting
themselves to constituencies rather
on the strength of recommendations
from the Radical Reform Junta, than
from any particular merits of their
own. By these men the Whigs are
especially persecuted, and may, perhaps,
in various instances, be beaten.
Yet, strange to say, the Whigs, as a
party, have not the courage to adopt
any distinct principle, or announce
any determined line of action, which
would serve at once to distinguish
and separate them from the fellowship
of these political adventurers. They
are ashamed of their old party names,
and persist in calling themselves Liberals.
Now, as we all know, Liberality
is, in politics, an exceedingly
comprehensive term. Cuffey was a
Liberal, so is Mr Feargus O’Connor;
so are Mr Joseph Hume, Mr John
M’Gregor, Mr Cobden, Mr W.J. Fox,
Lord Melgund, and Mr James Moncrieff.
And yet it would be difficult to
say upon what particular point, negations
excluded, one and all of these
gentlemen are agreed. The fact is—and
the Whigs know it—that there is no
such a thing as a united Liberal party,
and that the soldering up of their differences
is impossible. When a Whig
appeals to a constituency as a Liberal,
he is taking the worst and weakest,
because the most untenable, ground.
He is acting the part of the Girondists,
who persisted in claiming kindred
with the Montagnards, until the Mountain
fell upon and crushed them. It
is this feature which distinguishes the
present from every previous contest.
The chiefs of the Liberal sections profess
to act in concert and amity—they
hold meetings, pass resolutions, and
lay down plans for future operations—their
followers are as much opposed
to each other as Abram and Balthazar
of the House of Montague were
to Sampson and Gregory of the House
of Capulet. One thing alone they
agree in—they are determined to do
everything in their power to obstruct
her Majesty’s present Government.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is very needful that such matters
should be considered at the present
time—that sober-minded people, who
must take a part in the approaching
election, should thoroughly understand
the responsibility which devolves
upon them, and the consequences
which may ensue from their committing
an error of judgment. The influence
of party watchwords, though
materially lessened of late years, has
not yet ceased to exist; and it is
possible that some men may, through
a terror of being charged with political
inconsistency, actually commit themselves
to principles which they hold
in sincere abhorrence. Therefore it
is necessary to look, not only to the
past and present position of parties,
but also to their future prospects and
views, according to the support which
may be accorded to them by the
country at the general election.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us suppose that, at the opening
of the new Parliament, Lord Derby
should be defeated by a vote of want
of confidence. His resignation must
follow as a matter of course, and
then begins the strife. Past events
render it perfectly clear that the old
Whig Government cannot return to
office, or, if it could do so, must act
upon other principles than before.
Lord John Russell’s resignation in
February was an event which could
not have been long postponed. His
Cabinet was broken into divisions;
it was unpopular out of doors; and his
own conduct had, on various matters,
been such as to engender general
dissatisfaction. His Reform Bill was
a measure which gave vast umbrage
to the majority even of the urban
electors. Its introduction was, perhaps,
the most signal proof of his
political weakness, and, we may add,
of his ignorance of the state of popular
feeling. No matter whether it
was intended to be carried or not, it
remains, and ever will remain, an
example of the length to which
personal ambition may carry an unscrupulous
Minister. Earl Grey’s
administration of the Colonies has
become a byword for imbecility,
blundering, and disaster. The finances
were not in much better hands. No
movement was made by Sir Charles
Wood towards the termination of the
Income-Tax, nor had he even the
practical ability to reimpose it upon
an equitable basis. We do not allude
to these things by way of criticism
on the past—indeed it would be unnecessary
to do so, as they are
matters of common notoriety. We
state them merely to show that the
reconstruction of the Whig Government,
out of old materials, and on old
principles, is a thing impossible, and
that the next professing Liberal
Government must differ greatly in
kind and character from any which
has hitherto preceded it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Could it possibly be a moderate
Government? Let us first consider
that.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not only the Radical party, (who
must be looked upon as the chief
supporters of such a Government,)
but Lord John Russell and Sir James
Graham, are pledged to the introduction
of certain organic changes, differing
only in degree. To suppose that
any of them will adopt a less measure
than that which they have advocated,
is out of the question; and as the
tendency of the movement has been,
not from the Radicals to Lord John
Russell, but from Lord John Russell
to the Radicals, we may very naturally
conclude that the result would
be an approximation to the views of
Mr Cobden. That gentleman, as we
know, (for he does not scruple to tell
us so in as many words,) has “ulterior
objects” of his own, the time for developing
which in safety has probably
not yet arrived. We shall not inquire
too curiously into the nature of those,
being satisfied, as probably will be
most of our readers who have watched
the progress of the man, that they are
not at all calculated to improve the
stability of any of our institutions.
We cannot, therefore, see what hopes
can be entertained of the formation
of a moderate Government, supposing
Lord Derby’s to be overthrown;
unless, instead of uniting with Mr
Cobden, Lord John Russell could
effect a union with some other political
party.</p>

<p class='c010'>No such party exists. Unless we
are much deceived, the majority of
the followers of the late Sir Robert
Peel, at least the majority of those
who may be able to re-enter Parliament,
are prepared to give their support
and confidence to Lord Derby’s
Administration. There may, no
doubt, be exceptions. Sir James
Graham and Mr Cardwell are clearly
out of the Conservative ranks, and
may enlist under any banner they
choose. But as it is extremely problematical
whether either of these
gentlemen will obtain seats in the
new House of Commons, their views
are of little consequence. Other
Obstructives, of whom there are a
few, have no chance whatever of
being returned; so that the construction
of what we may term a moderate
Liberal Government could not take
place, from absolute want of material.
Indeed, judging from the language
lately employed by the knight of
Netherby, we should say that moderation
is as far from his thoughts as
from those of the rankest Radical in
Oldham.</p>

<p class='c010'>Unless, therefore, the electors are
really anxious for a Radical Government
and for Radical measures, they
ought to abstain from giving a vote
to any candidate who is hostile to
the continuance of Lord Derby’s
Administration. Let us not be misunderstood.
We are not now arguing
as to the propriety of sending Protectionists
instead of Free-Traders to
Parliament; we are not asking any
man to forsake his opinions on points
of commercial policy. Doubtless in
the next Parliament there will be
some opposed to the reimposition of
duties upon corn, who, nevertheless,
are prepared to accord their general
support to Lord Derby, the more
readily because he has distinctly
stated that he leaves the corn-duties
question “to the deliberate judgment
of the country, and to the general
concurrence of the country, without
which I shall not,” said he, “bring
forward that proposition.” But in
voting for any candidate, who sets
forward as a ground for his acceptance,
the fact that he belongs to what
is called “the Liberal party,” let the
electors remember that they are in
truth voting for Radical measures,
and for organic changes. They may
be slow to believe so, but there can
actually and absolutely be no other
result. These gentlemen of “the
Liberal party,” however moderate
their individual views may be,
seek to enter Parliament for the purpose
of overthrowing one Government
and establishing another. Of course
the overthrow must always precede
the reconstruction; and, most commonly,
it is not until the overthrow
has been made, that the plan of the
structure is considered. We have
already stated our reasons—and we
submit they are strong ones—for
thinking that no moderate Liberal
Government, in the proper sense of
the term, can be again constructed;
that Lord John Russell, if once more
summoned to form a Cabinet, must
do so on a Radical basis, and the inevitable
consequence must be the
establishment of a thorough democracy,
on the ruins of our present Constitution.
We appeal in this matter
as directly to the old constitutional
Whigs, as to that powerful body of the
electors, who, entertaining moderate
opinions, are attached to no particular
party in the state. We entreat them
earnestly to consider the difficulties
of the present crisis—difficulties which
have arisen not so much from any
increasing power of the Radical faction,
as from the weakness, vacillation,
and strong personal ambition of
the late Whig leader. No doubt it is
an honourable and a high ambition
which excites a statesman to aim at
the possession of power, but the
honour ceases the moment that principle
is abandoned. And it does appear
to us that, of late years, far too
little attention has been paid to the
terms of the conditions which are implied
by a Minister’s acceptance of
office. Under our constitutional monarchy
he is the servant of the
Crown, and he is bound to bring
forward such measures only as will
tend to the dignity and the safety
of that, and the welfare of the
people generally. Is it possible for
any one conscientiously to maintain
that Lord John Russell has pursued
such a course? Is it not, on the contrary,
apparent to all, that his main
object, and the leading thought of his
life, has ever been the supremacy of
his own political party? Has he not,
in order to prolong that supremacy,
approached repeatedly to factions
with whose principles he had nothing
in common, and purchased their
temporary support on terms alike
degrading to the giver and to the
recipient? That is not the art of
governing, at least as it was understood
of old. Once let it be known
that a Government is plastic—that it
may be bullied, coerced, or driven
into making terms—and its moral
power and influence are for ever gone.
Is there any reason—we would ask
the electors—why any man should
incur such risk as must arise from the
instalment of a Radical Ministry in
power, solely from personal devotion
to the interests of my Lord John
Russell? There may be some who
think that hitherto he has deserved
well of his country. So be it: we
have no objection that they should
entertain such an opinion. But this
much is undeniable, that however
good his intentions might be, he
neither could, nor can, command a
majority of direct followers of his
own; and that he has been forced to
scramble on from point to point by
the assistance of political antagonists,
dexterously availing himself, at each
turn, of the hand which was immediately
nearest. But this kind of course
must always have an end. A precipice
lay before him; and, as no other
arms were open, he leaped into those
of Mr Cobden.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the main body of the Whigs are
prepared to follow Lord John Russell
wherever he may go, notwithstanding
all that has passed, and all that he
has indicated for the future, we, of
course, can have no manner of objection.
But let them distinctly understand
what is in store for them if they
choose to adopt such a course. Many
of them, we know, were thoroughly
disgusted with the Reform Bill which
he introduced this Session; and did
not hesitate to express their conviction
that it was an unnecessary, dangerous,
and reprehensible measure. If Lord
John Russell returns to power, he
must bring in a new Reform Bill far
more democratic than the last. That
is the condition on which he is allowed
to retain the nominal leadership of
the Opposition, and from it he cannot
depart. The Manchester party will
not rest until they have attained their
end. They are for no half-measures;
they are plagued by no scruples.
Their doctrine is, that political power
should be vested in the uneducated
masses,—“the instinct of the million
being,” according to their great oracle,
“wiser than the wisdom of the wisest.”
In other words, mob rule is to be
paramount, and whatever the majority
wish to be done, must be straightway
put into execution. Is there any
reflecting man in the country who
does not shudder at the thought of
such a consummation?—is there any
one conversant with history who does
not see to what it must necessarily
lead? With no lack of demagogues
to mislead and excite them, what part
of the British fabric would be secure
against the attacks of an ignorant
democracy? It may be true that
Lord John Russell does not contemplate
this—that he would even shrink
from and repudiate the thought with
horror. But he is not the less doing
all in his power to forward the advance
of anarchy. By consenting to lower
the suffrage, he has given authority
and significance to demands far more
comprehensive in their scope. He
has indicated that the bulwark which
he himself erected, twenty years ago,
is not to be considered as permanent,
but merely temporary in its purpose.
He has begun, like the foolish dikebuilder
of Holland, to tamper with
the seawall of his own construction,
heedless of the inundation which must
follow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let the Whigs pause for a moment,
and consider what are the principles
maintained by the men with whom
their leader is now in alliance. Of
their notions on religious matters it is
difficult to speak with accuracy. One
large section of them consists of rank
Papists, men under the control and domination
of the Roman Catholic priesthood,
and ready to do their bidding in
anything that may advance the supremacy
of a false and apostate Church.
Another section professes to regard
all Churches and creeds as alike,
maintaining, as a fundamental doctrine,
that Establishments ought to
be abolished, and religious teaching
maintained only on the strict Voluntary
principle. The advocates of this view
are of course prepared to strike down
the Established Churches of England
and of Scotland, to overturn the whole
existing ecclesiastical arrangements,
and to confiscate ecclesiastical property.
Another section is supremely
indifferent to religious teaching of any
kind, regarding secular education as
quite sufficient for all the requirements
of the people. These are the
men who regard all opposition to
Papal aggression as sheer bigotry
and intolerance, who clamour for the
admission of Jews into one House of
Parliament, whilst in the same breath
they profess themselves ready to dismiss
the Christian prelates from the
other. In politics they are republican,
all except the name. But, in truth,
it matters little what name is given to
their creed, seeing that the principle
which they profess is that of pure
democracy. It is not pretended, and
certainly they do not pretend, that if
their scheme were carried, the House
of Peers could continue on its present
footing to coexist with the House of
Commons. They admit that they
have “ulterior objects”—all revolutionists
have—and these are left to
our conjecture. Is then our present
Constitution so faulty, that the great
body of the electors are prepared to
risk, and to recommend a change?</p>

<p class='c010'>If not, let them beware of returning
any man who will so far support Lord
John Russell as to act unscrupulously
against Lord Derby. By all means
let the measures of the present Government
be considered with the utmost
rigidness and exactitude, and
let no favour be shown to them beyond
what they conscientiously deserve.
The ordeal may be—must be,
a severe one; but Ministers will not
shrink from it, being conscious of the
integrity of their motives. But it is
no part of the game of Opposition to
allow them a fair trial, or even a fair
hearing, if they can in anywise be
prevented. They must, say the democrats,
be crushed—and that immediately.
Mr Cobden went the length
of counselling that they should not be
permitted to get through the business
of the present Session, so apprehensive
was he of the effect which an
appeal to the constitutional feelings
of the country might produce. He
and Mr Villiers had concocted a
scheme which they thought might
precipitate a crisis, but it was too
scandalously factious to admit of its
being carried into effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>The late Whig Government has
been tried, and found wanting. It
never can be reconstituted again, and
its old supporters are undoubtedly
released from all their ties of allegiance.
It will be for them to determine
whether they are to follow Lord
John Russell in his retreat to the
camp of the Radicals, or continue to
maintain those constitutional principles
which were once the boast of the
Whig party. The question is indeed
a serious and a momentous one. Lord
Derby has most clearly indicated the
nature of the ground on which he
stands. He does not appeal to the
country on this or that financial
measure—he comes forward as the
supporter of the Protestant institutions
of the realm, and as the determined
opponent of a designing and
encroaching democracy. What sound
Protestant, or true lover of his
country, can be indifferent to such
an appeal?</p>

<p class='c010'>We have been thus particular in
noticing the state of parties, because
we observe that various underlings of
the late Government are canvassing
constituencies, especially in Scotland,
in rather an artful manner. They
keep out of sight altogether the fact
of the Chesham Place alliance. They
are as unwilling to allude to that treaty
as to the notorious Lichfield House
compact, when the Whigs bartered
religious principle for Roman Catholic
support. Now, this may be very
convenient for those gentlemen; but,
we presume, the electors will agree
with us in thinking that the sooner
they can arrive at a distinct understanding
upon such points the better.
It is all very well to talk of “judicious
and timely reform,” but the
orator who uses such terms should
go a little further, and explain to his
audience the exact nature of the reform
which he contemplates. Because,
if Lord John Russell’s abortive
Bill is not to be introduced again,
but, in the event of his resumption
of office, another, revised by Mr Cobden,
and approximating to the full
requirements of the Manchester politicians,
is to be tabled instead—it
would be as well to know how far the
liberality of honourable candidates
will permit them to advance. Also,
it would be a curious and not unprofitable
subject of inquiry whether they
still hold themselves to be bound by
the acts of their parliamentary leader?
If they attended the meeting at Chesham
Place, they must be held as consenting
parties to the Cobden compact;
if they did not, it might not be
useless to ask who is their leader,
and what line of policy do they intend
to pursue? It is a good thing to hear
the abstract opinions of political soldiers
and subalterns; but in these
times, it is much more instructive to
learn the name of the captain of their
troop. None of the gentlemen to
whom we are alluding are likely to
originate measures—they must be
contented to take the word of command
from others. If, therefore, they
remain, and intend to remain, followers
of Lord John Russell, they form
part of that grand army of which Mr
Cobden is a general of division, if not
something higher. They have pronounced
for the democracy, and as
democrats they should accordingly be
viewed.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be exceedingly instructive
if we could exact from each candidate
a distinct definition of the meaning
which he attaches to the term “Liberal
principles.” We observe from the
Edinburgh newspapers that a gentleman,
professing “liberal principles,”
proposes to contest the representation
of the Montrose burghs with Mr
Joseph Hume—the inference being,
that the principles of the said Joseph
are not sufficiently liberal! Then, at
Paisley, a candidate recommended by
the same Joseph Hume, and that
superlative twaddler Sir Joshua
Walmsley, comes forward, on “liberal
principles,” to oppose Mr Hastie,
whom we have hitherto been
accustomed to regard as rather in
advance of the Whigs. The Radicals
of Perth did not think Mr Fox Maule
“liberal” enough for them, since they
brought forward an opponent in the
person of a certain Mr Gilpin; and
now that Mr Maule has succeeded to
the peerage, the gentleman who next
solicits the suffrages of the Fair City
in his place, must make up his mind
to compare his “liberal principles”
with those of the Gilpin. Not long
ago a well-known Whig citizen and
civic functionary of Edinburgh declared
himself opposed to any further
extension of the suffrage, thereby
intimating his dissent from the principle
of Lord John Russell’s Bill;
and yet, at a meeting lately held
for the purpose of selecting a candidate,
this same individual moved
a resolution to the effect that the
candidate ought to be a man professing
“liberal opinions!” Really there
is something ludicrous and intensely
absurd in this general employment of
a phrase which can be made to mean
almost anything. Is a man in favour
of a republic, abolition of the House
of Peers, suppression of the Church,
and repudiation of the national debt?
Then he is undoubtedly a man of
“liberal principles.” Is he merely
for household suffrage, electoral divisions,
vote by ballot, and triennial
parliaments? He is likewise of
“liberal principles.” Is he a thick-and-thin
supporter of Lord John
Russell, having held a place under
the late Government? Who so ready
as he to lay claim to “liberal principles.”
Does he wish the separation
of Church and State? “Liberal”
again. Does he back up the Papacy
in their insolent attempts at aggression,
and defend the grant of Maynooth?
He does so on “liberal principles.”
Does he wish to see the
Jews in Parliament? He vindicates
that wish on the score of “liberal
principles.” Now, surely, unless logic
is an art as lying as that of chiromancy,
it cannot be that all the men
holding such conflicting opinions are
entitled to the name of Liberals, or to
claim credit to themselves for entertaining
“liberal opinions.” If so,
who is illiberal? But it is not worth
while to comment further upon a point
so very obvious as this. If Liberalism
means contemplated overthrow and
anarchy, we make the gentlemen who
profess such principles as welcome
to their title as was the late Thomas
Paine, when he too arrogated to himself,
in his isolation, the name of
Liberal. If it means adherence to
the principles of the Constitution, love
of social order, and regard for the welfare
of the general body of the people,
we fear that we must deny the name
to a good many of those who claim it.</p>

<p class='c010'>One miserable feature in the conduct
of some of these <em>soi-disant</em> Liberal
candidates, especially the new ones,
is their extreme avidity to swallow
any pledge that may be proposed,
provided that, by so doing, they can
secure the suffrages of some inconsiderable
fraction of the electors. Their
addresses are not deliberate expositions
of their own formed opinions,
but are framed upon another and very
liberal principle. They endeavour to
ascertain the points of doctrine which
are supposed to be the most popular
with the constituency whom they are
ambitious to represent, and they issue
their manifestoes accordingly. If anything
has been omitted, or if they
have not gone far enough, an opportunity
is usually afforded them to
make up for that deficiency at the
first meeting of the electors—so called
by courtesy, for in many cases there
are not half-a-dozen electors, besides
those on the platform, in the room.
Such meetings are invariably attended
by the busy-bodies of the place—radical
cobblers, church-rate martyrs,
philosophical barbers, and perhaps
one or two specimens of that most
loathsome of all animals, the dirty
dandy. Here the candidate is expected
to go through his facings, and
to answer every question which insolence
can suggest, or ignorance render
unintelligible. No matter:—as our
friend is a member of the “Liberal
party,” he can safely expand his conscience
to any extent which may be
required; and the decisive and prompt
manner in which he frequently disposes
of the most knotty points of
social and political economy, is delightful
and edifying. Without ever
having read a single page on the subject,
he is quite ready to reconstruct
the Currency, and pledges himself to
bring in a bill to that effect, at the
request of a snuffy dealer in gingerbread,
who never had credit for five
pounds in his life, and who has
just made application for a <i><span lang="la">cessio
bonorum</span></i>. An individual in fustian,
evidently in the last stage of <em>delirium
tremens</em>, after a hiccupped harangue
on ecclesiastical rapacity, demands
from him his thoughts upon Church
Establishments in general; and the
liberal candidate at once undertakes
to have them all suppressed.
If his opinions on the subject of National
Education are somewhat vague,
the fault lies with the respectable non-elector,
who could not frame his question
so as to render it intelligible.
To one earnest inquirer—a carrier—he
promises an entire and compulsory
stoppage of Sunday trains. To
another—a publican—he pledges himself
to remove the excise duties from
British spirits. To a third—a cabman—he
indicates his resolution of
commencing a violent onslaught on
the Customs, so that “the poor
man’s tobacco” may be no longer
smoked under a sense of injustice.
Of course he disposes very summarily
of the Army, Navy, and Colonies, these
being parasitical weeds which ought
immediately to be done away with;
in fact, before he has done, there is
hardly one institution, tax, custom,
establishment, or system in the United
Kingdom which he has not denounced
as odious, and which he has not
pledged himself to alter! So convenient
are your “liberal principles”
in adjusting themselves to the popular
will.</p>

<p class='c010'>What takes place now, bad as it is,
is but a faint type of what would be
enacted if democracy had the upper-hand;
and we would recommend all
those who are sceptical as to this
matter, to attend personally some
meeting at which a candidate is subjected
to this kind of examination,
and mark the intelligence which is
displayed by the questioners, and the
consistency which is exhibited in the
replies. It is, indeed, as sorry a spectacle
as a man could wish to witness;
and could we suppose it to be a reflex
either of the mind of the electors, or
of the settled opinions of those who
are likely to be Liberal members of
Parliament, the idea would inevitably
cast a heavy gloom over our anticipations
for the future. But the truth is,
that the electors have little or nothing
to do with it; and the great majority
of the upstart aspirants after the
honours of legislation will, in a month
or so, return to their usual avocations,
probably not without an imprecation
on the folly which induced
them, at the bidding of an interested
faction, to suspend the humble toils
on which their daily bread depended,
and expose themselves alike to ridicule
and defeat. There are, however,
reflections of a very serious nature
suggested by the efforts which the
Radical party are making for the introduction
of organic changes, which
ought not to be lightly passed over.</p>

<p class='c010'>Why is it that certain parties are
now, more than heretofore, engaged
in getting up a cry for reform and
extension of suffrage?  Why is it
that some men, ostensibly belonging
to the Whig party, who, a year or
two ago, held such views in utter
detestation, have declared themselves
favourable to the movement? Has
anything been done to curtail the
popular privileges—to take away from
the people any portion of the power
which they previously possessed—to
curtail the liberty of the press—or in
any way to trench upon the rights
which are common to every subject?
Has there been any tyranny on the
part of the Crown—any audible complaint
against the acts of the House
of Peers? Nothing of the kind. Has,
then, the House of Commons failed in
the fulfilment of its duty?  That
averment can hardly be made, with
consistency at least, by any member
of the Liberal party, since they have
made it their boast that, at the present
moment, they are in possession
of a majority in the Lower House,
and have taken credit to themselves
for magnanimity in allowing Lord
Derby’s Ministry to exist, as they
say, by sufferance, until the ordinary
business of the Session is completed.
What, then, can be the motive for the
change which is now so loudly urged?
It is simply this: The Liberal party
are aware that they no longer possess
the confidence of the country, and
they hope, by rousing a new and
formidable agitation, to divert the
public mind into another channel, and
prevent it from dwelling upon the
injuries which they have inflicted upon
the industrious classes of the nation.
How otherwise can we account for
this sudden and violent mania for
extending the suffrage, which is apparent
in the election speeches of most
of the Liberal candidates? Mark the
inconsistency of these men.  They
tell us—no matter whether falsely or
not—that the country never was in a
state of greater prosperity than now,
and that such has been the fruit of
their earnest and triumphant efforts.
Very well. If it be so, what reason
can be urged for making any organic
change? Are not the prosperity and
the welfare of a nation, and that content
which, as we are told, reigns
among the working-classes, the surest
proofs that the Constitution is working
admirably; and would it not, in that
case, be utter madness to alter its
arrangement? Yet such is the dilemma
in which the Liberals, including
Lord John Russell, are placed. They
dare not aver that the country is not
prospering, seeing that, for many
years, they have had it all their own
way, and that any statement of the
kind would be tantamount to a censure
passed upon themselves. On
the contrary, they avow prosperity in
the highest degree, and yet they are
clamouring for a change, which cannot
improve, but may possibly imperil it!</p>

<p class='c010'>They cannot say that they demand
extension of the suffrage because the
acts of another Ministry might possibly
endanger the prosperity which
they assume to exist. Both the Radicals
and Lord John Russell had declared
for extension of the suffrage
long before Lord Derby was summoned
to take office. They were quite
as keen for organic change at the time
when they tauntingly told us that
Protection was coffined and buried for
ever, as they are now when they behold
it in life and motion. Nor can
they reasonably suppose that a cry
for extended suffrage will be generally
acceptable to the great body of the
present electors, who are jealous
enough of the privileges which they
have so long possessed, and are by no
means disposed to part with them, or
to be swamped by the uneducated
rabble. We are loath to suppose that
any, beyond the worst and most unprincipled
agitators of the Manchester
rump, are base enough to hope in
their hearts that they may succeed in
exciting popular tumult and disturbance.
We shall not consult Mr
Roebuck’s <cite>History of the Whig Ministry</cite>
for any similar passages in former
days—we content ourselves with the
assurance that no disposition of the
kind exists anywhere.  Therefore,
after looking at the subject in all its
bearings, we are constrained to come
to the conclusion, that all this talk
about reform on the part of the Liberals
has its origin in a sincere and not
unnatural desire to mislead the people
of this country, and to withdraw their
attention from those matters in which
they are immediately and most deeply
interested.</p>

<p class='c010'>The advocates of that system which
has been dominant for several years,
although its introduction is of an
older date, are, of course, loud in its
praise, and claim for it the credit of
full and triumphant success. We do
not deny that their system has, in the
mean time, had the effect of cheapening
commodities, though not in the
ratio which they predicted. The
price of the loaf, of sugar, and of various
other articles commonly termed
“of first necessity,” is lowered; and
we may fairly acknowledge that to
many this not only appears, but is, a
valuable boon. For, undoubtedly,
if we could procure all the articles
which we consume at a far lower
rate than before, retaining, at the
same time, our incomes undiminished,
we should each of us be immense
gainers—we might either work less,
and continue to live as formerly, or we
might work as formerly, and gradually
accumulate a capital; but if, in proportion
to the cheapness of commodities,
our incomes equally diminish,
then it is not easy to see wherein the
advantage lies.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is obvious, then, that at least one
class of persons—those who are in the
receipt of fixed incomes—must profit
materially by any system which induces
the cheapening of commodities.
The mere annuitant can now live
more comfortably than before; but as
annuitants do not constitute a very
large class of the community, and as
they necessarily must derive their incomes
from the product of internal
labour, we apprehend that, in treating
of such questions, it is proper to look
directly to the working and productive
classes. We do not intend to
argue over again points which we
have repeatedly discussed in previous
articles; our object just now is to
show that these pretended Liberals
have reason on their side in wishing
to escape from a calm and deliberate
investigation of the consequences of
their lauded policy.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are told by them that the
working-classes never were so comfortable
as they are just now. If we
believed this, and believed also that
the comfort <em>could be permanent</em>—because
both points of belief are necessary
before any one can be convinced
of the excellence of their system—we
should submit to the deep degradation
of acknowledging, in silence and
tears, our conversion to the tenets
of the men of Manchester. But,
unfortunately, we believe nothing of
the kind—nay, we know that the
contrary is the fact; and, first, let
us try to understand, if possible, the
meaning of the Free-Traders.</p>

<p class='c010'>We need not complicate the question
as to what the working-classes
are, by insisting that every man who
depends for his support upon his own
exertions belongs to that order.
Heaven knows that the pen is oftentimes
a more toilsome implement than
the shuttle or the spade; and, although
we cannot say that we ever
had a fancy to try our hand at the
loom, we would have no objection, on
occasion, to take a turn at trenching.
By the working-classes, we understand
those who are engaged in mechanical
toil—in tilling the earth,
cultivating its products, raising and
smelting its minerals, producing fabrics
from raw materials, and assisting
the operations of commerce and manufactures
in an endless variety of
ways. They are distinguished from
the capitalist in this, that they labour
with their hands, and that labour is
their sole inheritance.</p>

<p class='c010'>That it is the first duty of every
Government to guard and protect
that class, has been our invariable
doctrine. In them the motive strength
of Britain lies. Machinery is of man’s
invention—the human frame is the
work of God alone, animated by His
breath, and must not be treated as a
machine. They may be called upon—as
all of us are called upon—to
contribute some portion of their labour
for the maintenance of our national
institutions, which have undeniably
exempted us from those terrible calamities
by which almost every other
state in Europe has been visited. A
bad system of the entailment of state
debts, commenced more than a hundred
and sixty years ago by a monarch
who came over to this country
as a Liberator, has increased the
national burdens, and occasioned a
further tax upon labour. Yet, nevertheless,
it is undeniable that the condition
of the British labourer, in every
department of industry, has been for a
long time superior to that of his fellow
in any other European country. The
men of the working-classes are, though
they may not know it, possessed of
enormous power. Wronged they cannot
be, except by their own consent,
and as victims of delusion; for the
sympathy of the intelligence of the
country is with them, and so is that
of the higher orders. To all who
have true nobility of soul, the rights
of the working man are sacred; and
when that ceases to be the case, the
days of the aristocracy are numbered.</p>

<p class='c010'>But <em>why</em> is it that the condition of
the British labourer has been superior
to that of his foreign equal? That is
indeed a consideration of the very
greatest importance; and it would be
well if statistical compilers and political
economists had set themselves
seriously to consider “the reason
why,” instead of simply noting the
fact. We have read a good many
volumes—more than we care to enumerate—written
by gentlemen of that
class, but we never have been able to
find any intelligible explanation of
that phenomenon. Yet surely it is a
remarkable one. This country is, in
respect of its population, far more
heavily burdened than any of the
leading states of Europe—it has not
the climatic advantages of some of
them—and it can scarcely be said to
produce the precious metals. Its
exports, though undoubtedly large,
were, and are, as nothing to the
quantity produced, intended for the
home consumption. It has been computed,
from an investigation of the
census taken in 1841, that not much
more than half a million of people,
the population being then nearly
twenty seven millions, were employed
in the manufacture of articles for the
foreign trade.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c008'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It may be useful here to mention
that, according to one foreign statistical
authority, Schnabel, the proportion
of taxes paid yearly by each
individual in Great Britain, France,
and Prussia, was in the following
ratio:—</p>

<table class='table1'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c003'>Great Britain,</td>
    <td class='c004'>18</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c003'>France,</td>
    <td class='c004'>11⅔</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c003'>Prussia,</td>
    <td class='c004'>5½</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c010'>And the comparative rate of agricultural
wages is stated thus by Rau,
in his <cite><span lang="de">Lehrbuch der Politischen Oekonomie</span></cite>:—</p>

<table class='table1'>
  <tr>
    <th class='c003'></th>
    <th class='c015'>&#160;</th>
    <th class='c015'>S.</th>

    <td class='c014'>0</td>
    <td class='c004'>4⅔</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c010'>These figures, of course, may be
slightly inaccurate, but they are sufficient
to show the great variation,
both in taxation and wages, which
prevails in the three countries which
are here specified; and we have no
reason to believe that, during the few
years which have elapsed since these
calculations were made, any material
difference in proportion has taken
place. A similar discrepancy prevails
in wages of every kind. For
example, Mr Porter tells us that in
Wurtemberg the wages of the artisans
in towns are from 1s. 8d. to 4s. 2d.
per week; that in Bavaria “labourers
are paid at the rate of 8d. per day in
the country, and from 8d. to 1s. 4d.
in the towns;” and that in Saxony
“a man employed in his loom, working
very diligently from Monday
morning until Saturday night, from
five o’clock in the morning until dusk,
and even at times with a lamp, his
wife assisting him in finishing and
taking him the work, could not possibly
earn more than 20 groschen
(2s. 6d. sterling) per week.” We
might have added many other instances
to these, but we judge it to
be unnecessary. We quote them
simply for the purpose of showing
that labour in Britain, if heavily
taxed, was better remunerated than
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, why was it better remunerated?
That is—after all that has been
said and written on the subject, and
Eolus-bags of oratory, and hundreds
of thousands of reams of paper have
been expended on it—the question,
upon the solution of which the merit
of the rival systems depends. It was
better remunerated in this way—because
in Great Britain there has been
a far greater outlay of capital in every
department and branch of industry,
than has been made in any other
country of the world. With us, land
has been reclaimed, and brought under
tillage, which elsewhere would have
been left in a state of nature. At an
immense cost the difficulties of climate
have been overcome, and the soil
rendered productive, and capable of
sustaining an increased number of
inhabitants. We must go back farther
than the memory of the present generation
can reach, in order to appreciate
the vast nature of the improvements
which were so effected. Since
the commencement of the present
century, very nearly four millions of
acres, in England alone, have been
brought into cultivation under the
Inclosure Acts, besides all that has
been effected by private enterprise—and
it is probable that amount immensely
exceeds the other—on land
held by a simple tenure.  Eighty
years ago, the greater part of the surface
of what are now our best cultivated
counties, was covered with heath and
ling, and of course wholly unproductive.
It was from this outlay of
capital in the cultivation of the soil
that the rapid growth of our towns,
and the great increase of our manufactures,
took their rise. The latter
cannot precede—it must always follow
the other. The country supplied
the towns with food, and the towns
in turn supplied the country with
manufactures. Such being the case,
it is evident that the prosperity of
either interest depended greatly upon
the circumstances of the other. If
agriculture was depressed, from whatever
cause, there was no longer the
same demand as formerly for manufactures;
if manufactures were depressed,
the agriculturist suffered in
his turn. But in reality, except from
over-trading, and a competition
pushed to an extent which has affected
the national interest, it is difficult
to understand how a depression in
manufactures for the home trade could
take place, except through and in
consequence of agricultural calamity.
The home demand was remarkably
steady, and could be calculated upon
with almost a certainty of return. It
was reserved for the enlightened economists
of our age to discover that
the interests of agriculture and manufactures
were not harmonious. Such,
clearly, was not the theory of our
forefathers. The Book of Common
Prayer contains a form of thanksgiving
for a good harvest—it has
none for a year of unusual export and
import.</p>

<p class='c010'>We must not, however, pass over
without notice, the circumstances
which led to the extraordinary development
of industry and enterprise in
Great Britain, in every department.
Without consumers, it is quite evident
that agriculture could not have
advanced with such rapid strides;
and it is important that there should
be no misunderstanding on this matter.
The possession of a hundred or
a thousand acres of land is of little
value unless the owner can command
a remunerative market for his produce;
nor will he cultivate his land
to the utmost unless he has the assurance
of such a market. It is all very
well to say, that, by the expenditure
of a certain sum of money, such and
such an amount of crops may be
reared on each acre;—that is a mere
feat of agricultural chemistry, such as
Mr Huxtable offered to undertake
upon pure sand with the assistance of
pigs’ dung; but the real and only
question is—will the return meet the
outlay? Without some unusual and
extraordinary cause to increase the
number of consumers, it is clear to us
that the progress of agriculture must
have been comparatively slow; and
accordingly, we find that cause in the
Continental war, which continued for
nearly a quarter of a century, and which
has effected such mighty changes—the
end of which is not yet apparent—in
the social position of Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c010'>To maintain that war, the resources
of this country were taxed to the utmost.
So great were the demands,
that they could not possibly have been
met but for two things—one being the
result of internal arrangement, and
the other arising from external circumstances.
The first of these was the
suspension of cash payments, and the
extension, or rather creation, of credit,
arising from an unlimited paper
currency. The second was the monopoly
of the foreign markets, which we
engrossed, in virtue of our naval
supremacy. No writer on the social
state of Britain, even at the present
hour, and no political economist who
does not specially refer to these two
circumstances, are worth consulting.
Better put their volumes into the fire,
than discuss effects without regard to
their antecedent cause.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be that the extent to which
that unlimited currency was pushed,
has since had disastrous results. If
unwisely permitted without control or
regulation, it was, as we think, contracted
in a manner even more unwise;
and the practical consequence
has been an enormous addition to the
weight of the public debt. But without
a currency of very large extent—without
the credit which that currency
created—Great Britain could not have
continued the struggle so long, nor
brought it to a triumphant issue. It
was this that stimulated both agriculture
and manufactures, the latter
having, in addition, the inestimable
privilege of the command of the markets
of the world, without any interference
of a rival. Reclaimed fields
and new manufactories were the products
of that period; and unquestionably
there never was an era in our
history when prosperity appeared
to be more generally diffused. If
prices were high, so were wages.
Employment was plentiful, because
improvement was progressing on every
side, and no jealousy existed between
the manufacturer and the agriculturist.
During fifteen years, from 1801
to 1815, the average annual quantity
of wheat and wheat-flour imported
to this country was only 506,000
quarters.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps it may be instructive here
to quote the words of an acute observer
in 1816, regarding the improvements
which had taken place,
before any check occurred. The
writer of the historical summary in
the <cite>Edinburgh Annual Register</cite> for
that year thus expresses himself:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“During the continuance of the last
war, many things had conspired to stimulate
to the highest extent the exertions
of every class of the people of England.
Cut off by the decrees of Buonaparte
from direct intercourse with some of
the richest countries of Europe, the policy
which England had adopted in revenge
of this exclusion, had greatly increased
the action of those many circumstances
which naturally tended towards rendering
her the great, or rather the sole entrepot,
of the commerce of the world. In
her the whole of that colonial trade which
had formerly been sufficient to enrich,
not her alone, but France and Holland
also, had now centred. The inventive
zeal of her manufacturers had gone on
from year to year augmenting and improving
branches of industry, in which,
even before, she had been without a rival.
The increase of manufactures had been
attended with a perpetual increase in the
demand for agricultural produce, and the
events of the two years of scarcity (as
they were called) lent an additional
spring to the motion of those whose business
it was to meet this demand. The
increase which took place in the agricultural
improvements of the island, was
such as had never before been equalled in
any similar period of time. Invention
followed invention, for economising labour,
and increasing production; till throughout
no inconsiderable part of the whole
empire the face of the country was
changed. ‘It may safely be said,’ asserted
Mr Brougham, ‘that without at all comprehending
the waste lands wholly added
to the productive tenantry of the island,
not perhaps that two blades of grass now
grow where one only grew before, but
certainly that five grow where four
used to be; and that this kingdom, which
foreigners were wont to taunt as a mere
manufacturing and trading country, inhabited
by a shopkeeping nation, is, in
reality, for its size, by far the greatest
agricultural state in the world!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Contrary, perhaps, to the general
expectation, the close of the war and
the return of peace operated disastrously
upon the internal interests of
the country. Though the manufacturing
energies of the Continent had
been checked, its agriculture was ready
and available; and accordingly, no
sooner were the ports opened than
prices fell at an alarming rate. The
result was not only immediate agricultural
distress in Britain, but <em>the
greatest depression in every branch
of manufacture connected with the
home trade</em>. The agricultural distress
needs no explanation. The vast
improvements on land had been made
with borrowed money; and when
prices went down, the proprietor too
often found himself unable from his
rents to pay the bare interest of the
money expended. Yet, had these
improvements not taken place, how
could Britain have continued the
struggle so long—how could her
manufacturing population have been
fed? These are questions never considered
now, especially by those agitators
who revile the landlords, or
rather the Legislature, for the imposition
of the Corn Laws; but the truth
is, that, unless the corn duty had been
then imposed, England must, within
a very few years, either have exhibited
the humiliating spectacle of a
bankrupt and ruined state, or been
plunged in revolution. The distress
rapidly spread to the manufacturers—for
example, those engaged in the
silk trade, and the iron and coal-workers
of Staffordshire and Wales.
The fall in the price of corn produced
its natural effect by limiting the consumption
of everything else; and, as
if to crown the calamity, the exporting
manufacturers, in their eagerness
for gain, committed precisely the
same blunder, from the effects of
which they are now suffering so
severely; and by creating a glut in the
Continental markets, they both annihilated
their own profits, and excited
such an alarm in foreign governments
as to give rise to a system of prohibitory
duties, which continues to the
present hour. Then followed the
resumption of cash payments, with
all its train of ruin—a measure which,
whether necessary or not in principle,
could not have been carried but for
the existence of a corn law, which
in some degree mitigated its pressure.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a country so loaded with debt
as ours, it is in vain to talk, as Lord
John Russell lately did, of a “natural
price.” The term, indeed, has no
kind of significance under any circumstances;
and we are perfectly certain
that the noble lord, when he employed
it, was not attempting to
clothe a distinct idea in words. He
found the phrase somewhere—perhaps
borrowed it from the <cite>Economist</cite>—and
used it, because he thought it
sounded well. If he could reduce the
price of all commodities here to the
level of that which prevails in a Continental
country—a consummation
which appears to be contemplated
and desired by the Free-Traders—the
result would necessarily be a like decadence
of our wealth—not accompanied,
however, by a relaxation of
our present burdens. The high wages
which the working-classes receive in
this country, contrasted with the low
wages which are given elsewhere, depend
upon the return which is yielded
to the capitalist who calls their labour
into being. Now, let us see what
effect depression in any one great
branch of industry exercises upon the
working-classes, who are not immediately
dependent upon it for their
subsistence.</p>

<p class='c010'>This involves one of the most
curious phenomena in economical
science. When an interest is depressed,
it does not always happen—especially
in the first stage of depression—that
the labourers attached to
that interest feel immediately the consequences
of the decline. Agricultural
wages, for example, do not fluctuate
according to the price of wheat. The
retrenchment which becomes necessary
in consequence of lessened returns
is usually effected, in the first
instance at least, by curtailment of
personal expenditure on the part of
the cultivator—by abstinence from
purchases, not necessary indeed, but
convenient—and by that species of
circumspect, but nameless thrift,
which, at the end of a year, makes
a very considerable difference in
the amount of tradesmen’s bills.
This kind of retrenchment is the
easiest, the safest, and the most
humane; and it is not until the
depression becomes so great as to
render other and more stringent
modes of economising necessary, that
the agricultural labourer is actually
made to feel his entire dependence
upon the land, and the interest which
he has in its returns. The small
tradesmen and dealers in the country
and market towns are usually the
first to discern what is called the
pressure of the times. They find
that the farmers are no longer taking
from them the same quantity of
goods as before; that their stocks,
especially of the more expensive
articles, remain on their hands unsold;
and that there is no demand
for novelties. If the depression goes
so far as to necessitate a diminution
of rental, then the same economy,
but on a wider scale, is practised
by the landlord. Expensive luxuries
are given up, establishments
contracted, and the town’s-people
begin to complain of a dull season,
for which they find it impossible
to account, seeing that money
is declared to be cheap. All this
reacts upon the artisans very severely;
because in towns labour has a
far less certain tenure than in the
country; and when there is a cessation
of demand, workmen, however
skilled, are not only liable, but
certain to be dismissed. If the
shopkeeper cannot get his goods off
his hands, the manufacturer need not
expect to prevail upon him to give
any farther orders. The demand
upon the mills becomes slack, and
the manufacturer, finding that there
is no immediate prospect of revival,
considers it his duty to have recourse
to short time.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is precisely what has been
going on for the last two years.
Landlords and farmers have curtailed
their expenditure in consequence of
the great fall of prices; and the
parties who have actually suffered
the most are the tradesmen with
whom they commonly deal, and the
artisans in their employment. It
is impossible to affect materially the
gigantic interest of agriculture without
striking a heavy blow at the
prosperity of home manufactures;
and unfortunately these manufactures,
or at least many branches of them,
are now liable to foreign competition.
If it should be allowed that
this is a true statement of the case—and
we cannot see how it can be
controverted—then it will appear
that the working-classes, the vast
majority of whom are engaged in
producing for the home market, have
lost largely in employment if they
have gained by cheaper food.</p>

<p class='c010'>And it is most remarkable, that in
proportion as food has become cheap
in this country, so has emigration
increased. That is apparently one
of the strangest features of the whole
case. What contentment can there
be in a nation when the people are
deserting their native soil by hundreds
of thousands? They did not
do so while the other system was in
operation. Whatever were the faults
of Protection, it did not give rise to
scenes like the following, which we
find quoted in the <cite>Economist</cite> of 17th
April, as if it were something rather
to be proud of than otherwise. The
pious editor entitles it “The Exodus.”
Certainly he and his friends have
made Ireland the reverse of a land
flowing with milk and honey:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The flight of the population from
the south is thus described by the <cite>Clonmel
Chronicle</cite>:—‘The tide of emigration has
set in this year more strongly than ever
it has within our memories. During the
winter months, we used to observe solitary
groups wending their way towards
the sea-coast, but since the season opened,
(and a most beautiful one it is,)
these groups have been literally swelled
into shoals, and, travel what road you
may, you will find upon it strings of cars
and drays, laden with women and children
and household stuffs, journeying
onward, their final destination being
America. In all other parts of the
country it is the same. At every station
along the rail, from Goold’s Cross to
Sallins, the third-class carriages receive
their quota of emigrants. The Grand
Canal passage-boats, from Shannon harbour
to Sallins, appear every morning
at their accustomed hour, laden down
with emigrants and their luggage, on
their way to Dublin, and thence to Liverpool,
whence they take shipping for
America.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>And yet this wholesale expatriation
is so far from appearing a disastrous
sign, that it does not even excite
a word of comment from the
cold-blooded man of calculations.
Truly there are various points of
similarity between the constitution
of the Free-Trader and the frog!</p>

<p class='c010'>Remarkable undoubtedly it is, and
to be remarked and remembered in
all coming estimates of the character
and ability of the men, styling themselves
statesmen, whose measures have
led to the frightful depopulation of a
part of the British Empire. Remarkable
it is, but not to be wondered at,
seeing that the same thing must
occur in every instance where a great
branch of industry is not only checked,
but rendered unprofitable. Succeeding
generations will hardly believe
that it was the design of the Whigs
and the Free-Traders to feed the Irish
people with foreign grain, and so promote
their prosperity, at a time when
their sole wealth was derived from
agricultural produce. Just fancy
a scheme for promoting the prosperity
of Newcastle by importing
to it coals to be sold at half
the price for which that article is at
present delivered at the pit-mouth!
Conceive to yourselves the ecstasy
which would prevail in Manchester if
Swiss calicoes were brought there to
be vended at rates greatly lower than
are now charged by the master manufacturers!
Undoubtedly the people
of Newcastle and the operatives of
Manchester would in that case pay
less than formerly both for fuel and
clothing—both of them “first articles
of necessity;” but we rather imagine
that no long time would elapse before
there were palpable symptoms of a
very considerable emigration. And
lest, in their grand reliance in a monopoly
of coals and cottons, the Free-Traders
should scoff at our parallels as
altogether visionary, we challenge them
to make a trial in a case which is not
visionary. <em>Let them take off the manufacturing
protective duties which still
exist, and try the effect of that measure
upon Birmingham, Sheffield, and Paisley.</em>
Of course they know better than
to accept any such challenge; but we
warn the manufacturers—and let
them look to it in time—that the day
is rapidly drawing near when all
these duties must be repealed, unless
justice is done to the other suffering
interests. If they persist in asking
Free Trade, and in refusing all equivalents
or reparation for the mischief
they have done, <em>they shall have Free
Trade</em>, <span class='fss'>BUT ENTIRE</span>. Then we shall
see whether they—with all their machinery,
all their ingenuity, and all
their capital—with all their immunity
from burdens which are imposed
upon other classes—with all the stimulus
given to them by the income-tax,
now levied since 1842, in order
that taxes weighing on the manufacturing
interest might be repealed—can
compete on open terms in the
home market with the manufacturers
of the Continent. Do not let them
deceive themselves; that reckoning
is nigh at hand. They must be content
to accept the measure with
which they have meted to others;
and we tell them fairly, that they
need not hope that this subject will
be any longer overlooked. <em>Not one
rag of protection can be left to manufactures
of any kind, whether made
up or not</em>, if Free Trade is to be the
commercial principle of the country.
If so, the principle must be universally
recognised.</p>

<p class='c010'>What is now taking place in Ireland,
must, ere long, we are convinced,
take place in Britain. Nay, in so far
as Scotland is concerned, the same
symptoms are exhibited already, almost
in the same degree. In one
point of view, we cannot deplore the
emigration. If it is fated that,
through the blindness and cupidity
of men whose religious creed consists
of Trade Returns, and whose sole deity
is Mammon, the system which has
contributed so much to the greatness
and wealth of the nation, and which
has created a garden out of a wilderness,
is to be abandoned for ever, it is
better that our people should go elsewhere,
and find shelter under a
government which, if not monarchïcal,
may be more paternal than their
own. It is a bitter thing, that expatriation;
but it has been the destiny
of man since the Fall. They will
find fertile land to till in the prairies
of the West—they will have blue
skies above them, and a brighter sun
than here; and, if that be any consolation
to them in their exile, they
may still contribute to the supply of
food to the British market, without
paying, as they must have done had
they continued here, their quota to
the taxes of the country. But we
must fairly confess that we feel less
sympathy for those who go than for
those who are compelled to linger.
Until the home demand is revived—which
can only be in consequence of
the enhanced value of home produce—we
can see nothing but additional
misery in store for all those artisans
and operatives who are unconnected
with the foreign trade. With regard
to that trade, we have yet to learn
how it has prospered. Those who
are engaged in it admit that, in spite
of increased exports—which, be it
remembered, do not by any means
imply increased demand—their reasonable
hopes have been disappointed;
and that in regard to the
countries from which we now derive
the largest supply of corn, their exports
have materially decreased.
That is a symptom of no common
significance; for it shows that, simultaneously
with the increase of their
agriculture, those countries are fostering
and extending their own manufactures.
As for the other—the
home trade—it is, by the unanimous
acknowledgment of our opponents,
daily dwindling; and the income of
the country—as the last returns of
the property-tax, which do not by
any means disclose the whole amount
of the deficit, have shown us—has
fallen off six millions within the last
two years. Were we to add the
diminution on incomes under £150
per annum, we have no doubt
whatever that the loss would be
found to amount to more than three
times that sum. All that is so much
lost to the retailer and home manufacturer.
For a time, even yet, cheapness
may serve to palliate and disguise
the evil; but it cannot do so
long. Many important branches of
industry, such as the iron trade, are
in a state of extreme depression. The
evil is not confined to the mother
country; it is impoverishing the
fairest parts of our colonial empire.
Some of the sugar-growing colonies
are on the verge of abandonment.
Unless a very different policy from
that adopted by the Liberals is pursued
and sanctioned by the people of
this country, the catastrophe cannot
long be delayed; and then, perhaps,
the British public, though too late,
may be instructed as to the relative
value of colonial possessions of our
own, and those belonging to states
which do not recognise reciprocity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Years ago, when the Free-Traders
were in the first blush of their success,
and the minds of men were still inflamed
with the hot fever of speculation,
the advocates of the new
system were requested to state in
what way they proposed to employ
that mass of labour which must
necessarily be displaced by the substitution
of so much foreign produce
instead of our own. They answered,
with the joyousness of enthusiasm,
that there would be room enough and
to spare in the factories for every man
who might so be thrown out of employment.
It was not until an after
period that the stern and dreary
remedy of emigration was prescribed
and enforced—not until it had become
apparent from experience that
all their hopes of increased profit
from foreign trade and expected reciprocity
were based upon a delusion.
Then indeed the misery which had
been created by reckless legislation
was exalted into a cause for triumph,
and the Exodus of the poor from the
land of their birth, wherein they no
longer could find the means of labour,
was represented as a hopeful sign of
the future destinies of the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are very far, indeed, from
blaming those who, at the present
time, declare themselves averse to
any violent changes, and who think
that some remedy and redress may
be given, without having recourse to
an entire alteration of the principle
upon which our present commercial
policy is based. It may be that time
is yet required before the effects of
Free Trade can be fully felt and appreciated
by some of the classes of
this country; and, certainly, the first
step which ought to be taken in the
new Parliament, should be a readjustment
of taxation, corresponding
to the altered circumstances of the
community. Of course, as this demand
is founded strictly upon justice,
it will be opposed strenuously by
many of those who glory in their
Liberal opinions; but we believe that
the great bulk of the British people,
whatever may be their thoughts on
other points, have that regard to
justice, that they will not countenance
oppression. It may be that
the agricultural classes cannot yet
expect to receive that measure of relief
which they have waited and hoped
for so long. The partial failure of the
last harvest on the Continent, though
it has not brought up prices to a
remunerative level, has had more
than the effect of checking their further
decline; and that circumstance,
we are bound to admit, may have
some influence on the minds of many
who are slow to believe that foreign
importations can really affect the
permanence of British agriculture.
The experience of another season may
be necessary to open their eyes. So
far as we can gather from the opinions
of men who are engaged in the trade,
and who are best qualified to form a
judgment upon such subjects, we may
look almost immediately for a great
increase of importations, and a rapid
decline of prices. The failure on the
Continent did not extend to the
wheat crop—it was limited to the
rye and potatoes, the customary food
of the peasantry; and it is now ascertained
that there is a large surplus
of wheat ready to be thrown into our
ports. But it would be out of place
to discuss such points just now.
The verdict lies with the country,
to which Lord Derby has appealed.
If that verdict should not be of a
nature to enable him at once to
apply a remedy to agricultural distress,
by the reimposition of a duty
on corn, then we must look in the
first instance to such a readjustment
of burdens as shall at least give
fair play to the cultivator of the soil.
But there is much more than this.
The strength of the Protective case
lies in its universal application to all
classes of the community; and it is
not we, but our opponents, who affect
to regard it as a question in which no
one is interested beyond the landlord
and the tenant. We look upon it as
of vital importance to the retailer, the
tradesman, the artisan, and the home
manufacturer, and to all who labour
for them; and it appears to us that
the time has now arrived when a full
and searching Parliamentary inquiry
should be made on the subject of the
cheap loaf in connection with the rate
of wages, and the prosperity of the
home trade. Surely the Free-Traders
can have no reason to object to this.
They ground their case on philanthropy
and regard to the interest of
the poor and labouring man, and in
that respect we are both agreed.
Well then;—if, as we think and say,
agricultural distress, occasioned by the
low prices which have prevailed in consequence
of the large importations of
foreign corn, has had the effect of lessening
employment generally throughout
the country—a position which,
in our mind, is much strengthened
by the enormous and unprecedented
increase of emigration—surely that
proposition is capable of tangible proof
or equally distinct refutation. Let us
know, from authentic sources, not
from partial or interested assertion,
whether, along with the cheap loaf,
the people have had full and remunerative
employment—whether the
condition of the working-classes and
of the home interests has been improved
by the change or not. The
inquiry undoubtedly would be an
extended, but at the same time a
most valuable one. It would necessarily,
in order to arrive at a fair and
thorough understanding of the subject,
embrace the present state of
every trade as contrasted with that
of former years—it would show us in
what way the home market has been
affected by what we must still be allowed
to term a diminution of the means
of the purchaser. Surely such a subject
as this is well worth the pains of
inquiry. Parliament cannot be better
occupied than in receiving evidence
upon the condition of the people.
And we cannot rate too highly, either
for the present or the future, the importance
of such an investigation in
checking and correcting, or, it may
be, in confirming the doctrines of
political economy, as they are usually
quoted and received.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some, no doubt, may be interested
in opposing such an inquiry. We
have little expectation that the Manchester
men will accede to any such
reasonable proposal; for, as we have
already said, we regard this outcry
of theirs for wild and sweeping reform
simply as a ruse to withdraw the attention
of the public from the disastrous
effects of their lauded commercial
system. Lord John Russell and
his immediate Liberal followers would
probably oppose such an inquiry as
impious, because casting a doubt on
the infallibility of Whig tradition.
But we are convinced that sensible
and moderate men, of every shade of
opinion, would rejoice to see this
vexed question brought to something
like a practical test; so that,
whatever policy England may pursue
for the future, it shall at least
have for its object that of promoting
the welfare and the happiness of the
people.</p>

Theodore Johnson’s “Sights in the Gold Region:”—Speaking of the <em>Padres</em> of the
old mission of San Francisco Dolores, he says, “That these priests were cognisant
of the abundance of the precious metal at that period is now well known; but they
were members of the extraordinary society of the Jesuits, which, jealous of its all-pervading
influence, and dreading the effect of a large Protestant emigration to the
western as well as to the eastern shores of America, applied its powerful injunctions
of secresy to the members of the order; and their faithful obedience, during so long
a period, is another proof both of the strength and the danger of their organisation.”—(Second

word <em>quartz</em> in brackets after his word “marble,” under the impression that the old
Egyptian mines were, like the similar ones in California, really situated in veins of
quartz, and not of marble. We have since communicated with a gentleman who,
about twenty years ago, accompanied M. Linant, a French engineer in the service
of Mehemet Ali, to examine these mines, and he informs us that the gold was really
found in <em>quartz veins</em> traversing a black slaty rock. The locality, as may be seen in
Sharpe’s <cite>Chronology and Geography of Ancient Egypt</cite>, plate 10, is in the Eastern Desert,
about the middle of the great bend of the Nile, and about the 21st parallel. The
samples of rock brought down by M. Linant were considered rich enough to justify
the despatch of a body of miners, who were subsequently attacked by the natives,
and forced to abandon the place. A strong government would overcome this difficulty;
and modern modes of crushing and extraction might possibly render the mines
more productive than ever. A very interesting account of these mines is to be found
in a work by Quatremere de Quincy—“<cite><span lang="fr">Notice des Pays voisins de l’Egypte</span></cite>.”</p>

Light;” and perhaps what has occurred in the text may be supposed a plagiarism
from those words. But, in fact, nothing is more common than the craving and demand
for light a little before death. Let any consult his own sad experience in the
last moments of those whose gradual close he has watched and tended. What more
frequent than a prayer to open the shutters and let in the sun? What complaint
more repeated, and more touching, than “that it is growing dark?” I once knew a
sufferer—who did not then seem in immediate danger—suddenly order the sick room
to be lit up as if for a gala. When this was told to the physician, he said gravely,
“No worse sign.”</p>
